427049	3079504	300051	3.0	George Carlin is the only reason to see this	What happened to Kevin Smith ? This is terrible . At least when he made a bad film it was watchable , this is just a mess . Ben Affleck finds , marries and lose Jennifer Lopez and in the process is left with a little girl to raise . The movie mostly concerns how he is forced to find balance between career and family while learning to live again . Sounds promising ? So do many other movies that go down in flames . This is a film of pieces that work , pieces that don't and the inability to put them all together . The script is incredibly uneven with many " funny " lines that fall flat . The acting is fine but characters don't seem to belong to this movie , Liv Tyler , who is good , seems to be from a movie next door . George Carlin is beyond good . He's a real crotchety old guy who loves his son and his grand daughter and tells it like it is . To watch how he's grown as an actor since Outrageous Fortune is wonderful . Its a sad thing that he'll probably be forgotten come Oscar time . This movie was a head shaking experience . Kevin Smith , who usually can come up with good dialog is mostly flat here . Granted his " point and shoot " style of shooting a film is gone , but it seems to have taken with it the ability to tell a story . I give it simply because moments are very good - Carlin , the grade school Sweeney Todd , and a few other bits , but none of it really hangs together . Avoid this if you can .
485684	386241	71229	4.0	An interminable bore .	Michael Caine has always been one my favorite actors , but unfortunately he often starred in mediocre-at-best vehicles and had roles that wasted his talents . " Black Windmill " is such a vehicle : long , confusing , flat , nasty , interminable and thoroughly routine . The picture does show some occasional signs of wit ( watch for the early scene where the name " Sean Connery " is mentioned ) , but is really marred by its clumsy editing during the ( few ) action scenes . Even Caine himself just goes through the motions . At least the movie has the blue-eyed John Vernon , who makes a convincing villain .
513410	3223254	382625	8.0	The Da Vinci Code : The Movie	After all the hoopla and controversy parting the waters between the religious right and Catholic Church and the avid devotees of Dan Brown's multi-million dollar success book , the movie version is finally here . THE DA VINCI CODE makes a good movie - and that is enough . Director Ron Howard has assembled a good international cast , trusted the screenplay to Akiva Goldsman , and in fine Hollywood style has transformed an interesting premise of a story from Dan Brown's interested though unsophisticatedly written blockbuster into a suspense thriller . The story of a murder in the Louvre leading a former flatfoot detective turned writer of symbology and a French cryptographer on a chase involving the Vatican , the Opus Dei society , and the Priory guarding the Holy Grail is full of terrific visualizations of some of the encrypted secrets of Brown's novel and in the end the movie allows the viewer to follow the interesting story much more easily than did the book . The settings are magnificent ( cinematography by Salvatore Totino ) , the musical score by Hans Zimmer sweeps the story along embracing all aspects of the atmosphere , and the visual effects department has done a fine job with some tough tasks . The actors take their characters in stride , given that many of them are over the top figures : Ian McKellen will satisfy every reader's vision of Sir Leigh Teabing ; Paul Bettany is appropriately crazy as Silas ; Jean Reno offers a Captain Fache who manages to hold things together ; Audrey Tatou turns a fine spin as the all-important Sophie Neveu ; and Tom Hanks sleepwalks through his rather innocuous conception of Robert Langdon . And the ending is a rather sappy sellout not found in the book - but this is Hollywood . . . This film may set box office records - which seems to be the point in making it - and serves to prove what good PR work can do for a movie . Many will put down ' The Da Vinci Code ' because of religious reasons or other reasons , but in the end it is a just a good story well told - not a great movie but an entertaining one . Recommendation : a good 2 hour diversion , but not one to rush out to see until the crowds dwindle a bit . Grady Harp
392771	2483625	52792	7.0	The FBI For Richer Or Poorer	In the tradition of G-Men , The House On 92nd Street , The Street With No Name , now comes The FBI Story one of those carefully supervised films that showed the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the best possible light . While it's 48 year director J . Edgar Hoover was alive , it would be showed in no other kind of light . The book by Don Whitehead that this film is based on is a straight forward history of the bureau from it's founding in 1907 until roughly the time the film The FBI Story came out . It's important sometimes to remember there WAS an FBI before J . Edgar Hoover headed it . Some of that time is covered in the film as well . But Warner Brothers was not making a documentary so to give the FBI flesh and blood the fictional character of John ' Chip ' Hardesty was created . Hardesty as played by James Stewart is a career FBI man who graduated law school and rather than go in practice took a job with the bureau in the early twenties . In real life the Bureau was headed by William J . Burns of the Burns Private Detective Agency . It was in fact a grossly political operation then as is showed in the film . Burns was on the periphery of the scandals of the Harding administration . When Hoover was appointed in 1924 to bring professional law enforcement techniques and rigorous standards of competence in , he did just that . Through the Hardesty family which is Stewart and wife Vera Miles we see the history of the FBI unfold . In addition we see a lot of their personal family history which is completely integrated into the FBI's story itself . Stewart and Miles are most assuredly an all American couple . We follow the FBI through some of the cases Stewart is involved with , arresting Ku Klux Klan members , a plot to murder oil rich Indians , bringing down the notorious criminals of the thirties , their involvement with apprehending Nazi sympathizers in World War II and against Communist espionage in the Cold War . There is a kind of prologue portion where Stewart tells a class at the FBI Academy before going into the history of the bureau as it intertwines with his own . That involves a bomb placed on an airline by a son who purchased a lot of life insurance on his mother before the flight . Nick Adams will give you the creeps as the perpetrator and the story is sadly relevant today . Of course if The FBI Story were written and produced today it would reflect something different and not so all American . Still the FBI does have a story to tell and it is by no means a negative one . The FBI Story is not one of Jimmy Stewart's best films , but it's the first one I ever saw with my favorite actor in it so it has a special fondness for me . If the whole FBI were made up Jimmy Stewarts , I'd feel a lot better about it . There's also a good performance by Murray Hamilton as his friend and fellow agent who is killed in a shootout with Baby Face Nelson . Vera Miles didn't just marry Stewart , she in fact married the FBI as the film demonstrates . It's dated mostly , but still has a good and interesting story to tell .

It's a toss up on what he detests more . This was the film that spawned one of the best trilogies EVER . Most fall apart by the third movie ( : Godfather , Back to the Future , Star Wars ALL have weak links ) , not so here , ALL the Indiana Jones films are pure gold . And bring back very fond childhood memories . THIS is a action-packed blockbuster like it should be done . Thrilling , exciting , humorous , and insanely great escapism .

Katsu was his usual impudent self as he pursued those who would steal from the treasury to lend at usurious amounts to those who could not afford to pay . The usual amazing swordplay and skill of the big guy was present , along with the blood . I'm going to miss him .
544499	562732	472550	9.0	Like Dianne's , this one really adds to the story .	Of the three short plot hole videos included on the Shaun of the Dead DVD , Dianne's and Ed's add something new and unexpected to the story , while Shaun's simply illustrates what we already knew , while at the same time coming off as amusing and fun . Nick Frost narrates the brief and believable story of how he managed to , ah , survive the incoming onslaught of zombies from which Shaun and Liz barely escape . Granted , this is a zombie film , so the term " believable " has to be used in an entirely different way , but what I mean is that what happens in this little video fits with the rest of the story . And as with Dianne's story , there's a clever little joke in there at the end . Pretty fun stuff .

It portrays serial killer Jason Cravette ( Patrick O'Neal ) on his way to jail when he has to cut off his hand to escape . So , he returns to Baltimore and resumes his murders . Yes , the plot is pretty routine , but this movie is unique . The star is Cesare Danova , better known as Mayor Carmine DePasto in " Animal House " . Does that give the movie a feeling of silliness ? Maybe , but the movie mostly feels very neat . Also , the judge is played by Vinton Hayworth , aka Gen . Schaeffer on " I Dream of Jeannie " . So Bluto Blutarsky and Jeannie are linked by a hook-handed maniac ! Go figure ! But overall , this movie is a real treat . Fans of 1960s camp will surely love it . And it might just save your life one day . . . A murder mystery in Baltimore . I try to imagine if one or both of Baltimore's two famous sons ( by whom I mean Barry Levinson and John Waters ) had directed this movie . Hmmm . . .
430470	1173088	94500	4.0	Very disappointing	I grew up reading " The Lion , the Witch , and the Wardrobe " and must have read it over five or six times altogether as a child - which is rare for me because I'm not the sort of person who reads books more than once . The novel was clearly intended as a Christian allegory by its author , C . S . Lewis , a devout Christian . I think that's one of the clever aspects . What is not clever , however , is this 1988 TV adaptation . It's just not very good . The acting is subpar , the direction isn't very impressive , the special effects and everything are quite straight-to-TV . I'm not really looking forward to the new film adaptation either but at least the new one may be tolerable ( despite being an obvious cash-in on LotR ) - this one , if you've read the book , is genuinely disappointing . I didn't like it then , I don't like it now .
482092	1293485	443543	10.0	A cool magical twist on a story !	I was really excited to see " The Illusionist " and it met up to my expectations ! I am a huge fan of Edward Norton's , he's one of today's most under rated actors , I wish I would see him in more films , but I guess we'll just have to wait and see . My only concern was Jessia Beil , she doesn't seem like the old day's type of a movie actress . She was kind of a bummer to the film , she couldn't keep up with a British accent , but she didn't do too bad of a job . But it's the others who truly keep this amazing film going . The story is about a man , Eisenheir ( spelling ? ) , he is an illusionist / magician , and we aren't just talking pulling a rabbit out of a hat , he does the most amazing tricks that would make you think that he was made of magic . But it is the duchess played by Beil who steals his heart and they have a scandalous affair since she is engaged to the emperor's son . When she attempts to leave him , she is murdered by his hand , and the chief inspector tries to find out who the murderer is . When Eisenheir starts to do amazing beyond the dead images to the public including his love , he gets into big trouble , but plays all the men with his amazing acts into a great ending ! I really hope The Illusionist does well at the awards ceremony , it deserves it . Believe me when I say that this is one of the best films I have seen in 2006 , considering what we have had , I'm extremely happy that Hollywood brought us a great and unique story . It's a great film and I can't wait for the DVD ! Thank you , Edward for bringing us a movie that could bring us our hopes for better films !
477440	463200	244244	8.0	Stupid but fun	A hacker named Stanley ( Hugh Jackman ) is hired by the mysterious Gabriel ( John Travolta ) to break into a computerized bank file that contains billions of dollars and steal it . There's more to it , but plot is not the primary concern of this film . What is front and center is action - - car chases , crashes , explosions , gun fights , etc etc . The plot's " logic " disappears half way through , but the action never lets up . It's loud , fast , furious and lots of fun . Surprisingly , the acting is also good considering the actors had nothing to work with . Travolta is OK . . . not great , just OK . He's done better . Jackman is wonderful as Stanley - - handsome , buff and full of charisma - - very talented . Halle Berry is also very good in a supporting role - - yes , she bares her breast and yes , it's worth it . Stupid film , but never boring . A good , violent action film . Recommended .

Once they are rescued , the boy attempts to keep the animal as a pet , but the Stallion is more comfortable on the racetrack . Although Mickey Rooney gives one of his very finest performances as the congenial horse-trainer who takes the kid under his wing , the picture changes focus in the second-half and never quite lives up to its early magic . At a lengthy two hours , the movie does cross the finish line all right , but we don't care as much about the horse-racing stuff as we do for the characters ( human and animal ) involved . The youngster is played by newcomer Kelly Reno , who is charmingly low-keyed ( much like Henry Thomas in " E . T . " ) and wise without being precocious ; Teri Garr has a thankless role as Reno's mother , but it's still nice just having her around . Rooney deserved his Oscar nomination for completely inhabiting and enlivening an otherwise clichéd role . from
437243	306861	43890	10.0	Master Of All He Surveys	A Walt Disney DONALD DUCK Cartoon . Donald wants nothing OUT OF SCALE in his elaborate backyard model railroad and town - including Chip ' n ' Dale and their tree . Here is another typical Duck versus Chipmunks film - fun & fast-moving , but no classic . The cartoon is rare in that amity reigns over all at the conclusion . Clarence Nash provides Donald with his unique voice ; the Chipmunks are largely unintelligible . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by pictures & drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew comic figures on the sides of his vehicle . Back in Kansas City , along with artist Ub Iwerks , Walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated commercials and tiny cartoons for the local movie theaters . Always the innovator , his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series broke ground in placing a live figure in a cartoon universe . Business reversals sent Disney & Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923 , where Walt's older brother Roy became his lifelong business manager & counselor . When a mildly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was snatched away by the distributor , the character of Mickey Mouse sprung into Walt's imagination , ensuring Disney's immortality . The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut , STEAMBOAT WILLIE ( 1928 ) , a tremendous audience success with its use of synchronized music . The SILLY SYMPHONIES soon appeared , and Walt's growing crew of marvelously talented animators were quickly conquering new territory with full color , illusions of depth and radical advancements in personality development , an arena in which Walt's genius was unbeatable . Mickey's feisty , naughty behavior had captured millions of fans , but he was soon to be joined by other animated companions : temperamental Donald Duck , intellectually-challenged Goofy and energetic Pluto . All this was in preparation for Walt's grandest dream - feature length animated films . Against a blizzard of doomsayers , Walt persevered and over the next decades delighted children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White , Pinocchio , Dumbo , Bambi & Peter Pan . Walt never forgot that his fortunes were all started by a mouse , or that childlike simplicity of message and lots of hard work always pay off .
399086	1391795	99165	4.0	I can't say I like it but I don't exactly despise it either .	Regarded by many critics as one of the biggest stinkers of all time ( certainly the biggest stinker of director Brian De Palma's career ) . Sherman McCoy ( Tom Hanks ) is a smug rich boy whose life goes to pieces when he and his lover Maria Ruskin ( Melanie Griffith ) are involved in a hit-and-run . His story is chronicled by another smug guy , reporter Peter Fallow ( Bruce Willis ) . Well , as I said in my summary . . . What is this movie supposed to be ? It seems to combine comedy , drama , and satire , but it sure doesn't add up to much . It's undermined by unimaginably loathsome , one-dimensional characters who you'd never want to have the displeasure of meeting in real life . I'm no big fan of the novel ( I started reading it once , but couldn't finish it because it wasn't to my liking ) but it's obvious to me that those who did / do enjoy the novel consider this film to be a complete travesty . I've never seen so many talented actors strive to hard to give a below-average movie some semblance of quality and fail . What a waste . The problems start with casting nice guy Tom Hanks in a role that is clearly supposed to be UNsympathetic . And the role of Peter Fallow in the novel was that of a Brit . Bruce Willis is badly , BADLY miscast in the role . What was the thinking there . Alas , not even Morgan Freeman can escape the film with his dignity intact , being obliged to deliver a lame , heavy-handed lecture on ' decency ' after the climax . This movie ends up turning into an absurd farce . I liked the assemblage of talent ; for that I will give it , but I'm sure some people will say a MUCH better movie could have been made from the source material .
514653	317399	444890	8.0	A Nutshell Review : Perth	Perth is Harry Lee's retirement plan . As an ex-army commando regular turned security supervisor of a shipyard , he leads a nonchalant life , where he regularly exclaims to others that he's a simple man with little materialistic desires , and harbours a goal to settle in Perth , Australia , where life down under is said to be good . When retrenched , he seeks employment as a taxi driver , but ever looking for that break in life to earn more cash to achieve his objective . However , things turn out more complicated for Harry . When sober , we see the empty facade Harry exudes to others , but we learn of the true state of his life when in drunkenness , pouring out his woes to his friends - he's separated from his cheating , gambling wife , and his son refuses to acknowledge him . His is a lonely sad life , and this movie takes a look at the life of the forgotten pioneers of Singapore's materialistic success . We follow his path to the seedier side of the Lion City , into the world of pimps and prostitutes , where he has a lucrative job to ferry the girls to their customers , no questions asked . A depression-proof job , says his friend Angry Boy Lee . Somehow , coffeeshops feature prominently in Singapore movies of late , and Perth is no different , where characters sit around and rant about the authorities , give subtle jibes on the army , and the eventuality of army regulars after their retirement from the uniformed services . They go on about how a better life in Singapore equates first to having a good education , how materialism has crept into society's moral fiber , and the greener pastures available abroad for the lowly skilled . The jibes on the ang-moh's are not subtle though , them being cursed at and assaulted . We know Harry is a violent man from his inner thoughts , but early in the film , it's like his bark is deadlier than his bite . The occasional rant aside , Harry is a man who values faithfulness and loyalty . He fails to see that though his family might not exhibit these values ( probably due to his inner violent nature which led to domestic violence ) , his friends like Angry Boy and Selvam , actually do . The subplot on love and his budding relationship with a Vietnamese call girl at times drags the movie , but it is necessary to lead the movie to its extremely violent finale . The language used throughout is colourful , and I could not think of a local Hokkien expletive not spewed in this film . Perth looks like a one man show from its trailer and poster , with Lim Kay Tong putting in a wonderful performance in shouldering the movie , but gladly , a cast of familiar ( and perhaps stereotypical ) supporting characters help add some depth and sometimes , dark humour . You'll see familiar faces from local TV productions too , like Channel 8's Liu Qiu Lian as Harry's wife . From the laughter amongst the audience , Angry Boy Lee and Selvam are easily favourite characters of some . It's a dark and gritty film , some might consider a local adaptation of Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver . But perhaps expectations will be set too high if benchmarked against that classic . This is story of Harry Lee , not Travis Bickle , so put the comparisons aside , and enjoy the ride .
421069	2542703	480025	7.0	This is England-Union Jack at its Worst	Here we go again . An 11 year old loses his dad in 1983 in the Falklands War . Bullied in school and very unhappy with his life , our young chap , who gives a wonderful performance , is recruited by a bunch of skin-headed losers . He resorts to violence . My criticisms of the film include his mother who scolds the group for keeping her son late and then goes on her merry way and the boy becomes a bona fide member . The film wants us to evoke sympathy for this brat . Yes , I call him a brat because of his actions . Not everyone who loses a parent at 11 resorts to such behavior . Let's stop making excuses for this type of recalcitrant conduct . The film does have redeeming value when the boy sees the death of a black member by the leader is a rage caused by the use of drugs . Question : Since when is a black person allowed to be in such a group ?
497549	1355507	365677	5.0	Worth watching for some laughs but that's it .	Red Water is set in the Louisiana swamps & rivers where a company has set up a mini drilling platform & are searching for oil , meanwhile environmentalist Dr . Kelli Raymond ( Kirsty Swanson ) has hired John Sanders ( Lou Diamond Phillips ) her ex-husbands fishing boat to take her to the rig so she can conduct some tests to see what effect the drilling is having on the local wildlife . To complicate things further two gangsters Ice ( Coolio ) & Brett ( Langly Kirkwood ) are searching for 3 million dollars in stolen drug money in the same stretch of river & if that wasn't enough there's an angry killer man eating Bullshark swimming around that was hurt in an explosion set off by the oil rig workers . One thing leads to another , people get eaten , people get greedy & when it all kicks off someone has to save the day . . . Executive produced & directed by Charles Robert Carner this is a pretty bad film although I have to say if you go into it in the right frame of mind there are a few laughs to be had here . The script by J . D . Feigelson & Chris Mack doesn't seem to take itself too seriously & at least it moves along at a nice pace so it's not boring & generally speaking there's always something happening but there are so many plot holes , ridiculous scenes & bad dialogue that you really can't take the film seriously . For a start how did a car end up at the bottom of an isolated Louisiana river ? Would someone who makes a living as a fisherman on a boat really not be able to swim ? I mean wouldn't being able to swim be a job requirement ? Steel cranes don't just suddenly collapse for no reason . The drill blows up but then is suddenly & miraculously repaired & in perfect working order again at the end . Could someone really find a gun at the bottom of a river in the middle of the night when they don't even know where it is ? There are other bit & pieces I could mention but I think you get the point . Then there's the character's who are all pretty clichéd , from Lou Diamond Phillips courageous hero to the slimy money hungry company executive & the terrible stereotypical urban gangster that is Coolio with baggy clothes , a bad attitude & a gun . As I said Red Water is decent for a few laughs but anyone looking for another Jaws ( 1975 ) this is a millions from it . Director Carner does OK on what was probably a low budget , he doesn't direct with much pace or excitement though & as a result it's not scary , it has no tension & it's all a bit flat . For some reason the shark seems to take a back seat for most of the film as the hidden money gets more screen time , there's also a green environmental message of the moral variety here as well but there's no great subtly about it & it's nothing we haven't seen before . Forget about any gore , there's some blood & a severed arm but that's about it . Made-for-TV this is meant to be set in Louisiana but was in fact filmed in South Africa & the free holiday was probably the main reason the likes of Diamond Phillips , Kirsty Swanson & Coolio wanted anything to do with it . It's reasonably well made I suppose , the special effects aren't great especially the GCI shark which for most of the time looks pretty rubbish . Red Water is a pretty bad film for sure , so bad it's good film lovers will probably like it though & I thought it was worth a few laughs . Personally I think you could do worse but at the same time you could do better .

Music and animation in concert ( sorry ) with one another . While all the studios did this , with varying degrees of success , Walter Lantz , with his Swing Symphonies ( set to jazz ) and Musical Miniatures ( classical ) was most successful in doing these types of shorts routinely . As usual , Woody Woodpecker quite outshines Andy Panda , but the short is great fun and well worth hunting down . It's a pity that the Lantz material isn't in wider circulation than it is at present . Recommended .
549161	1111192	91225	3.0	This duck simply was destined not to fly .	This movie was a bomb when it was released , but fortunately over the years it has attained a sort of cult following so there are people who enjoy this film . I am not one of them , however , I found this movie a bit boring with a rather stupid concept . Not that it doesn't have anything to it , I actually chuckle at some of it , overall though it is not much of a ride . I have to agree with the one reviewer that said one of the problems with this movie is that it looks cheap . Which is surprising considering we have the man who made the Star Wars trilogy behind this film . Unfortunately , you can't tell he had anything to do with this movie as the effects look like a cheap science fiction television show's special effects . The duck , the star of the show is annoying and the star of the show should not be a character you tire of hearing from during the course of the movie . Then there is the switch in the flick from a bit of a comedy to strange alien invasion movie that adds seriousness and action to a movie that would have probably benefited greatly from more comedy and a change in the way Howard spoke . Then the movie ends with a rock concert ending that is so lame you will roll your eyes and turn off your tape or change the channel before it finishes . It is funny though that I think this movie originated from a comic book . At the time there were so many comic books that had yet been translated to the big screen , I wonder why they decided to make this one ?
515384	317399	489282	6.0	A Nutshell Review : Strange Wilderness	One of the reasons why I decided to watch this , is because I needed a comedy to laugh at , if it's not possible to laugh together with it . The DVD is already available at the shops , but I don't think I'm ready to fork out a Code 1 DVD price for what's essentially a short comedic film which is based from a Saturday Night Life comedy skit . Written by the same creative team of Peter Gaulke and Fred Wolf with the latter taking on directorial duties as well , Strange Wilderness delivered some genuine laughs , but only if you're tolerant of being insensitive to the kind of subject the film makes fun of . Strange Wilderness is a long running wildlife programme which is now succeeded by Peter ( Steve Zahn ) , the host of the show , whose father had made the programme into one of the best loved prime time shows . Under Peter's leadership , ratings have plummeted , and needless to say even their 3am timeslot is in danger of being canceled . In a last minute desperation for survival , he and his crew have to look for a new way to ensure their programme continues , and dropped at their laps is the opportunity to follow up on a solid lead to the whereabouts of Bigfoot . Eseentially this movie is one big road trip that tells of the crew's journey to documentary history , with the likes of soundman and co-collaborator Fred ( Allen Covert ) , Cooker ( Jonah Hill ) , the only female in the team Cheryl ( Ashley Scott ) , and cameraman Junior ( Justin Long ) , amongst others . And throughout the movie , we see each and everyone of them getting into enough funny scenarios that made this film look like many pieces of skits being glued together , with laughs coming courtesy of sexual innuendos ( you just got to hand it to the turkey ) , sight gags , slapstick and just plain buffoony . In fact , I even suspect that everyone in the cast were on a high as they shot this , as dialogues were laced quite incoherently with plenty of ad-libbing , especially Justin Long , though of course if he's really acting , then kudos to him for being stoned all the time . While giving no respect to wildlife , the funniest moments were reserved for their voice overs of Nature , and it's really quite incredible should anything like it be actually aired for television . They are intentionally full of factual errors , lapse into unnecessary judgmental and slanted viewpoints , but always just plain ridiculously funny . Perhaps I was in crap mode , but the humor here doesn't apologize for any offence made , since after all , the subject matter can't fight back anyway . I know I'm shallow if I say I really couldn't get enough of the film poking fun at the physical features / defects repeatedly . There is no plot in the movie , besides everyone being perpetually broke as they try and scrimp or come out with more hare-brained ideas to fund their movie and fuel the laughs . So the bottomline is , don't expect any genius from Strange Wilderness , but if you're in for some low-brow humor , then this movie might just be the perfect laughing medicine for anyone wanting to chase the blues away , without any medicinal assistance .

Unfortunately for them , they get caught and attacked from all angles . . . Perhaps the episode of Victory at Sea that most details the German defeat in the Atlantic Ocean at the Allies ' side . Exciting footage dominates the last several minutes with stirring narration from Leonard Graves and likewise music from Richard Rodgers contributing the appropriate mood throughout . A salute to all the men , living and dead , who helped make the world safe for democracy during these trying times indeed . As always , this and other episodes of Victory at Sea are most highly recommended .
404702	2020269	365265	6.0	A tale of two werewolf-sisters !	The fresh and ingenious " Ginger Snaps " - trilogy comes to an end with this prequel that takes Ginger and her sister Brigitte back to early 19th century Canada . Although a remarkably stylish and well-made horror film , this final entry is the weakest of three . This is merely due to the rather " ordinary " werewolf-story and the lack of metaphors and oppressed humor that made its predecessors so unique . After a boating-accident , the two siblings are orphaned and they strand in some sort of military fort . The few remaining men left there are obviously frightened of something and it soon turns out that the fort is regularly attacked by bloodthirsty werewolves . These wolves are former men who went on a journey to get supplies but they never came back ? . as humans . When Ginger gets bitten and slowly begins to " turn " , her sister Brigitte remains at her side even though she's the only one who can break the curse by killing her . As mentioned before , the story isn't that special ( in fact , it's identical to the happenings in the first Ginger Snaps ) but the sets and costumes are very effective . The events that overcome the two sisters also remain compelling because you feel connected with them after two sublime movies . Both Perkins and Isabelle's acting performances are flawless and they receive good feedback from the unknown supportive cast members . There are some exhilarating gore-sequences to enjoy and the werewolves look impressive . Ginger Snaps Back is good entertainment , with talented leading ladies and a lot of action . My favorite film of the entire franchise will remain part two ( Unleashed ) because that one is so wonderfully demented , shocking and depressing . In fact , it was the best horror film released in 2004 , although this third part is definitely in the top 10 as well . Recommended !
409801	2567136	29217	6.0	Scarface - Lite	Looking at this entry in the 21st century it's easy to see how well it fitted into the Warner ' House ' style of social realism . Although it carries a disclaimer it was apparently no secret to anyone and his Uncle Max that Eduardo Cianelli's Johnny Vanning was heavily based on ' Lucky ' Luciano and also contained elements of an actual recent event . It is , of course , a Bette Davis movie as was virtually everything she appeared in after Of Human Bondage through approximately All About Eve but Bogie is on hand yet again - they would eventually make a half dozen movies together - this time playing the ' good ' guy in the shape of a District Attorney loosely based on Thomas E . Dewey , who is committed to nailing Vanning . His third wife-to-be Mayo Methet is also along for the ride as one of the ' hostesses ' albeit slightly long in the tooth as Vanning points out when he ' acquires ' them along with the ' club ' where they work . It's all fairly predictable ; Davis is the chippie with a case of the smarts who's far too shrewd to testify against Vanning until , of course , her kid sister - who thinks Davis works in a dress shop - turns up unexpectedly and is sucked into Vanning's web and ends up with a tag on her toe thus triggering Davis ' volte-face for which she pays with a cross carved on her face . Worth a look but not much more .
383063	449021	83907	8.0	A true horror classic .	Director Sam Raimi and good friend Bruce Campbell set out to make a real scary movie . . . although filmed on 16mm , THE EVIL DEAD is good enough to be your next nightmare and a hell of a lot better than your run of the mill slice and dice . Campbell plays Ash Williams , one of five college friends set out to have a wild weekend in the woods . Two guys . . . three girls journey to a remote cabin , of course in the middle of the woods . And the woods whisper " Join Us " . The group stumbles upon a book and a tape recorder belonging to the previous inhabitants , warning of evil spirits lurking in the woods . When the dead come out to play , the newest victims turn into horrid ghouls . Ash , who at heart is a cowardly pansy , turns out to be the macho , macho man to the rescue . It takes courage , a shotgun and a chainsaw . When the flesh-eating demons start their attack , the blood doesn't just ooze ; it splatters , gushes and flows by the bucketful . And there is the scene where one of the girls is beckoned into the woods only to be attacked and raped by a . . . tree ? ! Cheap special effects galore decorate this vacation to a little north of Hell . The comedy was unintentional . It is a product of bad acting by actors with little or no experience . But still , Raimi as writer and director has stumbled upon something here . THE EVIL DEAD more than deserves its youth restricted rating . As if it really matters , other cast members are : Betsy Baker , Hal Delrich , Ellen Sandweiss and Theresa Tilly .
468998	1532177	117492	1.0	Galveston Oh Galveston	Apologies if the above summary doesn't tie in with the rest of the review but the title reminded me of the Glenn Campbell song . Truth be told singalonga Glenn was th only pleasure I got while watching this dire TVM . A black woman called Jordan decides to open a care home in order to make some money . Not a very exciting plot but it's difficult to explain how dire it all is because of many very slow scenes . Did I say it's dire ? Good because I want to spell it out for you - This TVM is D-I-R-E . The first third of the story features some of the slowest scenes ever witnessed in a TVM . The worst thing is these scenes usually end up going absolutely nowhere anyway so why were they included ? Strangely for a TVM we're treated to the " N " word , the " B " word and even the " O " word but this doesn't make THE ROAD TO GALVESTON a more eventful journey . The only positive thing about this TVM is that it points out that it's a very bad idea to let a drunk supervise senile old ladies but I guess everyone knew that same as everyone knows letting your kids spend the night at Neverland ranch can lead to dire consequences Number of times the word " dire " appeared in the above review - 5
486367	386241	75163	4.0	Overlong , exploitative and generally boring .	Seeing " Salon Kitty " in its uncut version turned out to be a mixed blessing ; at 133 minutes ( ! ! ) this movie is way overlong . Any chances it might have had of being taken seriously as a historical drama are quickly destroyed by Tinto Brass ' excessive focus on male and female genitalia . Within the first 10 minutes , you've already seen enough flapping ds to last you a lifetime . And later on , in what must be a screen first ( thank you Mr . Brass ) , we even get a full-frontal nude shot of a deformed midget ! " Salon Kitty " is just as outrageously exploitative as the infamous " Caligula " . It may not match that film in the " quantity " of its perversions , but it more than matches it in the " quality " . Also like " Caligula " , the film has a vague , barely-existent storyline which doesn't begin to make its points ( about using Nazism as a vehicle for power and sexual domination ) until the last 10 minutes , and lacks any characters the audience can relate to . The woman played by Teresa Ann Savoy could have been such a character , but the actress , while luscious , is not very expressive ; all the others are way over-the-top . The production is handsome , but for some reason everything seems to be bathed in white . And the language is an ungodly mess . Most of the dialogue is in English ( clearly not dubbed ) , some of it is in Italian and there a couple of German lines as well ! ( )
548360	1111192	52169	1.0	Booooorrrrrrrriiiiiinnnnngggggg ! ! ! ! ! ! !	That is the best way I can describe this movie which centers on a newly married couple who move into a house that is haunted by the husband's first wife who died under mysterious circumstances . That sounds well and good , but what plays out is an hour of pure boredom . In fact one of the funny things about this flick is that there is a warning at the beginning of the film that promises anyone who dies of fright a free coffin . Well trust me , no one ever took them up on that offer unless someone out there is terrified of plastic skulls , peacocks , weird gardeners , and doors being knocked on . And the music is the worst , it consists of constant tuba music which sounds like it is being played by some sixth grader . And you will figure out the terrible secret that is so obvious that you really have to wonder what the people in this movie were thinking . Someone dies while running and hitting their head and the police are never called to investigate . Yes in the end this is a slow paced ( which is really bad considering the movie is only just over an hour ) , boring little tale , that is easily figured out by the average person . Apparently none of the characters in this flick were the average person .
489816	33913	108724	8.0	Better than ER at the time !	ER was satisfactory but Chicago Hope was superior with mature cast of characters played by a stellar cast of actors and actresses . I loved the relationship between Mandy Patinkin and Adam Arkin . It appeared to be doing fine until Peter MacNichol who played the lawyer Alan Birch left the show and joined Ally MacBeal . Roxanne Hart played a nurse who was married to Arkin's character . Hector Elizondo appeared to be the heart and soul of the show . Christine Lahti later joined the show but the show lost it when cast members like McNichol and Patinkin who chose to leave for other opportunities and spend more time with his family . When ER and Chicago Hope first came on , I have to say that Chicago Hope had a greater edge than it's sister show also set in Chicago but ER seemed more elementary and spent more time dealing with personal relationships . I think Chicago Hope tried to do both very well and it would have had the original cast stayed on board .
574016	4532636	858479	5.0	A Movie About Smart Dumb People and Dumb Smart People	With a title like " Smart People , " you just know there's a lesson to be learned in this movie , and that it probably has something to do with people who think they're smarter than they are . Those people are Dennis Quaid , a tiresome boor of a college lit professor who nobody likes , and his equally tiresome and snarky daughter , played by Ellen Page as a young Republican version of Juno . These two pompous asses make snap judgements about everybody and think nobody's worth wasting the time to interact with . Of course , in both cases , the characters are making up for insecure deficiencies , brought about mostly by the death of their wife and mother . The dumb people who end up being smarter than the smart people are Thomas Haden Church , as a loaf of an adopted brother who has a fondness for laying around with his bare ass waving in the wind ; and Sarah Jessica Parker , as an emergency room doctor and former student of Quaid's who strikes up a romance with him . O . k . , so she was pretty smart to begin with , but not in the way that Quaid and Page think she should be . . . . you get the point . What does all of this add up to , you ask ? A movie that I had forgotten about as soon as I stowed away my half-eaten box of Junior Mints and began strolling toward the exit . " Smart People " isn't a bad movie , but it's an awfully inconsequential one . It doesn't add up to anything , and that's o . k . - - some of the best movies are those that don't try to change the world . But a movie needs to have SOMETHING - - either a plot or characters to care about , one or two original ideas , a fancy style . This has none of these things . The plot is lazy and has a been-there-done-that quality to it . It just sort of meanders along until it reaches a hastily-realized happy ending . Paradoxically , though there are really only four main characters , I felt like none of the actors had enough screen time to really flesh their characters out . Or more precisely , they didn't have good enough material to make use of the screen time they were given . Poor Thomas Haden Church gets the worst of this . On paper , it would appear that his brother / uncle character is important to the story , but the way it plays out , it feels like Church showed up on the set one day and everyone scrambled around to find stuff for him to do . His character doesn't feel at all integrated into the movie , even though he's the one we'd rather be spending our time with . " Smart People " feels like what it probably is : a movie about a very specific milieu that either the writer or director ( or both ) have direct and personal experience with , but that they unsuccessfully translated into a universal story that anyone could appreciate . I was on a business trip and had nothing else to do , so I was able to just go with the flow and moderately enjoy this movie , but a must-see it most certainly isn't .

True , the wheezing , inane plot and phony contrivances of " Two of a Kind " are tough to wade through , yet the film has a cartoonish kind of magic that is appealing , especially if you're an admirer of Olivia Newton-John ( looking her best here ) . John Travolta , on the other hand , is slumming it , walking through a rather hopeless role as a would-be inventor so deep in debt he stoops to robbing a bank ; Newton-John is the teller who dupes him out of a small fortune . Cheesy , but big-hearted film is a sweet fairy tale , a comic-book romance that doesn't strive for much more than silly laughs and star-crossed love . from
365104	4888011	36271	10.0	one of the most unpredictable cartoons	One of the things that I've always liked the most about the Looney Tunes / Merrie Melodies cartoons is their unpredictability . " Porky Pig's Feat " goes all the way , as Porky and Daffy come up with all sorts of elaborate schemes to try and escape from a hotel . You see , the effete manager has charged them for things like air ( for breathing ) , while Daffy gambled away all the money . The whole thing escalates into full-scale war . Aside from what Porky and Daffy do to the owner - and what he does back to them - the last segment was a surprise . Then again , movie studios and executives always like to advertise themselves ( Porky mentions Leon Schlesinger ) . Overall , a really funny cartoon . So , in conclusion , let's all help them get their " Feat " back on the ground ( apologies to the Beatles ) .
548638	1111192	381061	10.0	This Bond movie is a royal flush .	I really enjoyed this film and it is the best movie I have seen this year as it is the only one I have given a ten too . Usually in a year there are at least two , and sometimes more , this year seemed destined to have none until I saw this movie . What can I say , I just had to have a little faith that 007 would save the day and movie year . Granted I enjoyed " Die Another Day " a lot too , it was all gadgets and special effects . . . this one I liked because of the simplicity of it all . The gadgets are all but gone , the action is more stunt work than special effects and this one really looks at the character of Bond like no other Bond film has because this is the beginning of his 00 career . Craig is really good as Bond as I would say he is rather close to the best Bond Sean Connery . Though I have enjoyed all the actors who have played that character so far . The action is great , but that is to be expected , the emotional twists in the story were not expected and were welcome by me , this movie shows us just what has made James Bond who he is . Judi Dench returns as M and is solid as usual , and she was rather funny in some of her scenes . The story has Bond tracking a man who is sort of a banker for terrorist . This man has a plan that Bond foils and costs him quite a lot of money , which this man hopes to win back in a game of Poker . So Bond gets in on the game and is joined by a lovely lady whom he apparently is falling for bad . This movie plays out very well and I look forward to seeing it again , as I also look forward to seeing Craig as James Bond again .
564507	102816	325258	10.0	This is knucking futs !	David Spade is one of my fave SNL stars and he's made better movies than the rest of his old pals ( It's Pat , Coneheads and Master of Disguise are among the worst films ever made ) . I especially liked him as the voice of Kuzko in the Emperor's New Groove . Here he plays Dickie Roberts : ( former ) Child Star , a kid at the top , but a man at the bottom and absolutely desperate for a comeback . His agent ( John Lovitz ) cannot find him any work outside of celebrity boxing , his girlfriend has dumped him and Dickie's main source of income is parking cars . You get the picture , he's a completely fallen star . Rob Reiner has a role that Dickie would love to get his hands on but Rob wont touch him because it requires an actor who knows ' normal ' , someone who knows how to be an adult , someone who had a proper childhood . Desperate to get the part , Dickie hires an ordinary middle-class family ( dedicated mum , workaholic dad , bullied son , wishful daughter ) to look after him like proper parents . Trouble naturally follows . But Dickie's hijinks lessen and his new family's tolerance increases . Yes , they do learn from each other and become better people ( yadda yadda ) but there is just so much fun and craziness along the way and some genuine character moments . There are loads of celebrity cameos ( Tom Arnold , Corey Feldman , Brendan Fraser , Dustin Diamond ) and lots of biting satire and the movie industry but the bulk of the film relies upon Dickie learning family values and having fun with the kids , being a kid . Proof positive that he's still the best ( former ) SNL star . The only bad thing I can mention is Adam Sandler's involvement as executive producer , something that seriously tarnishes the film and prevents it from having any real class . The DVD is in great looking 2 . 35 : 1 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby 5 . 1 sound and quite a few extras .
517421	1132073	82334	10.0	An unbelievable film !	This movie follows very close to the happenings of the true story . The film is very realistic and it is some what disturbing . Barbara Hershey and Ron Silver were good . I believe this happened . Some viewers complained about the nudity and I myself dislike it but I think it was needed to show how the evil force did its bad work on that poor lady . If you like spooky films especially true horror films and are able to see the Entity then do see it because its one that you don't want to miss !
516852	1132073	64757	9.0	OHMSS is a very good action packed Bond film with a great ending !	George Lazenby played a very good James Bond and its a shame he didn't play the role anymore . OHMSS is a very good 007 film that is filled with lots of realistic fights . I just couldn't believe the ending of the film . I was really surprised . Telly Savales played Blofeld very good but his Blofeld was much different that the late great Donald Plesence's Blofeld . If you like James Bond I think you'll like this one a lot !
366210	3109237	70215	8.0	It's like Leone Meets the Three Stooges	- All that gunslinger Jack Beauregard ( Henry Fonda ) wants to do is retire while he's still alive . But Nobody ( Terence Hill ) wants to see Beauregard go out in blaze of glory . Nobody dogs him across the West insisting that if Beauregard will just face one more enemy , he's sure to go down in the annals of history . But Nobody's idea is for Beauregard to have it out with the 150 man strong Wild Bunch - all alone . - The shortest and most to the point description that I can come up with for this movie is " Sergio Leone Meets the Three Stooges " . On the one hand , you've got Henry Fonda in the traditional Western role ( albeit Spaghetti Western ) . On the other hand , you've got Terence Hill performing some of the best slapstick and pantomime since the era of the silent film . It sounds like an unlikely combination , but Valerii successfully marries the two styles into a very enjoyable experience . The scenes with Fonda and Hill together are as good as you'll see in a Spaghetti Western . - While some of Hill's comedy seems goofy and doesn't work that well , most of it is very funny . There are moments of pure genius . The shooting scene in the saloon is a particular favorite of mine . - Morricone's score is amazing . He draws inspiration from and pays homage to some of the earlier scores he did . I was reminded several times of Once Upon a Time in the West , the Dollars Trilogy , and other Spaghetti Westerns . Writing positive comments on a Morricone score is becoming a bit redundant . Did he ever write a score that you could call bad ? - For those of us who have only seen My Name is Nobody on VHS with bad transfers and missing footage , the new Image DVD is a real treat . It was a lot like watching the movie for the first time . I never thought this movie could look so good . My only complaint is the lack of extras . The disc doesn't even have a trailer .
423336	2248099	36342	9.0	Dark and brooding thriller from the master of suspense	It is well known that this film is Alfred Hitchcock's favourite of his own oeuvre , and it's a big favourite of mine also . It is also well documented that for this film , Hitchcock stated that he " wants to bring violence back into the home , where it belongs " and he has certainly succeeded at doing that . Hitchcock spends much of the early screen time building up the family at the centre of the tale , and then allowing the violence to come to them , which shows Hitchcock's mastery of the medium as showing the story develop in this way makes the tale much more frightening than if we hadn't got to know the family at the centre of the story first . Joseph Cotten stars as uncle Charlie ; a man fleeing Philadelphia to escape the law after marrying and then murdering several rich widows . He goes to stay with his sister and her family , which includes a husband , two young children and the eldest daughter ; his niece and namesake ; also called ' Charlie ' . Hitchcock puts the focus of the story on young Charlie and her relationship with her uncle . This gives the story a frightening angle as it follows the classic tale of the strange uncle . It's also well done as young Charlie is shown to be the sweetest of characters , and when the dark uncle Charlie enters the fray , her sweet world is infected by nightmares , which also gives way to elements of the classic ' coming of age ' tale to enter the proceedings . As if that wasn't enough , Shadow of a Doubt also exposes the trust we put in our loved ones , and how any person is likely to try and shift the blame , or ignore it completely , if their loved one has done wrong . This is shown by the way that young Charlie still attempts to cover for her beloved uncle even when all the evidence is pointing to him being guilty . Hitchcock has turned this thriller , which could easily have been routine , into a complex study of a family that retains it's interest throughout due to the multiple themes on display . Joseph Cotten was the absolute perfect choice to play uncle Charlie . His portrayal is picture perfect ; he carries with him an atmosphere of dread and morbidity throughout , even when he's not doing anything wrong . A role of this sort is difficult to get right , as it's all to easy to underplay it so it isn't effective , or to overstate it so it becomes ridiculous ; but Cotten gets the performance spot on . Teresa Wright , who stars alongside Cotten in the role of the other Charlie also does well and delivers a mature and assured performance that fits her character brilliantly . Some of the supporting roles look a little suspect at times , but on the whole the acting from the support is good enough . The ending of the film comes somewhat against the run of play and is maybe a little bit too over the top after the rest of the film , which is largely down to earth . However , it does work and a big ending isn't something I am in the habit of complaining about . This is up there with Hitchcock's best work and therefore is highly recommended .
453117	15896852	20143	4.0	Marion Meets the Moustache	Marion Davies moves unsteadily into sound films , as the title character in the musical " Marianne " . This was Davies ' first sound film ; a silent version was filmed earlier . In her first aural offering , Ms . Davies combines silent mannerisms with a sometimes lilting , sometimes grunting French accent . Davies is admired by several U . S . soldiers , but mostly Lawrence Gray ( as Stagg ) . Mr . Gray helps retrieve Davies ' stolen pig , albeit mostly eaten . There are several embarrassing scenes , but the film really goes downhill during a musical number involving Benny Rubin ( Sam ) and Cliff Edwards ( Soapy ) serenading a distraught Davies . This song and dance is followed by Davies doing deep knee bends , in drag , while bragging about her intimacy with a General . Later on , she does musical impressions of Maurice Chevalier and Sarah Bernhardt . They are not as fun as they sound ! Mr . Rubin sings " The Girl from Neufchâteau " extremely well , though ; his is the film's best musical performance . The best scene occurs with Davies in a military jeep , with Gray ; she is still disguised as a male officer , complete with moustache and a cap . The scene works because Davies , instead of playing a French woman , play-acts a French officer . Here , she proves herself an actress well-suited for talking pictures . You may also notice her sometimes uncanny resemblance to Lucille Ball ; especially , recall Ms . Ball's " Lucy Meets the Moustache " ( 1960 ) . It is most obvious Ball referenced some of Davies ' comic work .
576579	1399158	96071	6.0	The Serpent And The Rainbow ( Wes Craven , 1988 )	I had intended to watch this one after I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE ( 1943 ) , given its similar voodoo backdrop ; however , I could only manage to follow THE GHOST SHIP ( 1943 ) with it - and that's because the latter doesn't have an accompanying Audio Commentary on Warners ' DVD edition ! It's an intriguing film with some very striking imagery - particularly during the numerous hallucinations which afflict lead Bill Pullman ( the most incredible was the snake darting out of a corpse's mouth ! ) - but which is rather too unpleasant in detail to be easily enjoyed . The cast also highlights Cathy Tyson ( star of MONA LISA [ 1986 ] ) as the Haitian doctor who helps - and falls for - Pullman , Paul Winfield as a local mystic , the always welcome Michael Gough ( as Pullman's boss back in the U . S . - who ends up witnessing , with the former , a rather effective dinner-table possession by the wife of their mutual employer ! ) , Brent Jennings ( as a specialized drug dealer ) and , particularly , Zakes Mokae as the truly evil figure of authority who crushes down all opposition with brutal methods ( but also resorting to the supernatural if this proves especially persistent ! ) . Still , the zombies here end up being something of a cheat - but , given the film's supposed basis in reality , I guess that's understandable . Then again , there's an effects-laden climax ( including an amusing bit in which the Paul Winfield character tears off his own head and throws it at Pullman ! ) which is not a little far-fetched ; the utterly convincing location work does , however , bring to life the dire political situation of Haiti at the time . Unfortunately , footage of cockfighting was censored for the U . K . version - and , in fact , there are no such scenes in the Region 2 DVD I watched ! Apparently , Wade Davis ( the author of the book on which the film was based ) had higher aspirations for his story , as his ideal choice of director was Peter Weir - with Mel Gibson as the star ! ! This is surely among the best ( of the admittedly little I've watched ) of Craven's work ; however , I'll be making amends with another title I rented - THE PEOPLE UNDER THE STAIRS ( 1991 ) - and should be receiving the R1 2-Disc Set of THE HILLS HAVE EYES ( 1977 ; purchased as part of a Halloween Horror Sale at Deep Discount DVD ) in the coming weeks . . .
421188	2542703	475276	10.0	United 93 is Testimony to Profiles in Courage	Outstanding film by director Paul Greenglass which depicted that awful day - Sept . 11 , 2001 when America changed forever . With a cast of relative unknowns , Greenglass is admirably able to depict the events as seen by the Air-Traffic Controllers at various places while the evil plot of the day was unfolding . People viewing this masterpiece will be totally gripped by the action scenes as the dastardly plot came about . The tension is thick and well shown . You feel that you can identify with those passengers and attendants as they made those tragic cell phone calls to relatives to tell them how much they loved them . I was one who felt that it was too early to make such a movie . How wrong I was . This movie shall forever be in testament to the brave actions taken by those doomed souls on a day that will also live in infamy .
402606	453228	713613	8.0	Neat	I like the special effects ! The water guy / spirit effect was great . The show does a tribute to the old Friday the thirteenth movies with the camera shots of the lake and woods . The part with the boat is a homage to the first movie . The get out of town sheriff finds out they are faking being conservation officers is a great staple of the show . ( The stunt is played on every show and I love it ) The mystery is resolved , and the spirit must be exorcised . I like Ratt's Round and Round track . It was a good homage for the 80's type of guy who gives the show a certain style and feel of the 80's . I guess Round and Round is what the brothers do . I like the hint of sexual frustration by the brother Dean moving on and the attractive waitress shows so much attention for him . The small town mood and setting for Wisconsin is so accurate . Brings back memories for how much I like Wisconsin when I was passing through there . Even the towns people were true to life , excellent research . Bravo a good show . .
498648	1355507	257510	3.0	The sequel that nobody wanted , at least it's not as bad as Tobe Hoopers original .	Four heavily armed men wearing balaclavas burst into the ' Arizona Millennium Bank ' and proceed to rob it . Before they can escape the police turn up and the following shoot-out ends in a massacre of both police and innocent customers . The four robbers manage to escape unharmed . Then it's off to ' Orange County Airport ' . One of the stewardess on flight 211 to Accapulco named Mia ( Heidi Lenhart as Heidi Noelle Lenhart ) talks to her boyfriend , Zach ( Chuck Walczak ) who's already there sunning himself by a pool . Mia says she'll be there soon . The four bank robbing murderers from the opening sequence , Max ( Darryl Theirse ) , Sol ( Jon Sklaroff ) , Squid ( James Parks ) and Pete ( Billy Reick ) are also going to Accapulco on flight 211 , and manage to smuggle guns , ammunition and stolen money on board . Crocodile 2 was obviously made before a certain date that will go down in history . Julie ( Anna Cranage ) is the other stewardess . As they fly , the plane encounters awful weather conditions , a violent thunder storm . The pilot ( Dan Martin ) is told to turn back . Max , Sol , Squid and Pete are rather unhappy about this and hijack the plane . Max and Squid burst into the cockpit and force the pilot to carry on to Mexico . Sol and Pete try to keep the passengers under control , to prove his point Sol shoots a kid in the face called Sean ( Sean Euro ) . Hearing the gunshot Max and Squid are distracted in the cockpit and the pilot and his co-pilot ( Eddy Chamichian ) sense their chance and try to disarm Max and Squid . In the ensuing struggle the planes instruments are damaged and the plane crashes in ' Devils Swamp ' , somewhere in Mexico . Max , Sol , and Squid survive . As does Julie and Mia , plus the obligatory teenager Brian ( Steve Moreno ) , a lawyer named Justin ( David Valcin ) , a nurse ( possibly Rachel Henry who is listed as ' injured passenger ' , the filmmakers don't even bother to give her an on screen name ) and the pilot . Max convinces the survivors to carry their stolen money across the swamps to a village named Santa Christo , by pointing guns at them and shooting the already injured nurse dead , because she will slow them all down . The pilot is suddenly attacked and killed by a crocodile . Max and Co . shoot the crocodile dead . They all head off into the swamp . A massive crocodile finds it's mate floating dead on the surface of the swamp . It sets out for revenge . First of all it eats Julie . Meanwhile , in Accapulco Zach has heard about the plane crash on the box . He hires Roland ( Martin Kove ) to help him track down Mia who he believes may still be alive . They manage to find Mia , and the rest of the survivors . Zach and Roland are then also thrown into the situation and have to survive the killer crocodiles constant attacks . Will they be able to make it back to civilisation or possibly be rescued before they all end up as crocodile food ? Watch it to find out ! Directed by Gary Jones this isn't a particularly great film but is a lot better than Tobe Hoopers original Crocodile ( 2000 ) . The script by Jace Anderson and Adam Gierasch , who both helped write the screenplay for the original , is split in two . The first half is a bank heist film , the robbery and the plane hijack . The crocodile doesn't appear until after the 45 minute mark and then the film becomes a pretty straight horror for the rest of it's run time . The ending is a bit stupid and I'm not entirely convinced that what happened would be possible in reality . The script features a silly amount of bad language , in fact it becomes extremely irritating as the bad guys have to swear every couple of words . It's reasonably well paced and mildly entertaining for what it is . This is a film where the script probably looked half decent , unfortunately the filmmakers didn't really have the money or dare I say it , the talent to make it work . I mean the plane crash probably sounded cool as the written word but the finished sequence ended up rather lame with poor special effects , the same could also be said for the fight Roland and Max have in a helicopter as it flies over the swamp . The special effects are mixed , they range from awful to OK but their generally better than the original's . There's not much gore , but the attacks all contain a fair amount of blood . Most of the actors are forgettable except Martin Kove who is pretty watchable and doesn't deserve to be reduced to making films like this . Not particularly good , but it just about kept me entertained for 90 odd minutes on a certain level .
363039	4888011	421239	7.0	more than ( air ) plain	Knowing that " Red Eye " comes from the man who gave us " The Hills Have Eyes " , " A Nightmare on Elm Street " and " Scream " , we would probably expect a slasher movie . It turns out that this is nothing of the sort . What we have here is a slick thriller in the vein of another airplane-set movie from last year , " Flightplan " . And a very clever one at that . It all begins when hotel clerk Lisa Reisert ( Rachel McAdams ) is headed for the Dallas airport to catch a plane back to Miami . Upon learning that her flight has been delayed , Lisa waits in line , where she gets to know one Jack Rippner ( Cillian Murphy ) , an extremely likable everyman . Lo and behold , she's sitting next to him on the plane . But right after the plane takes off is when she learns what he really wants : he wants her to change a government agent's room reservation in her Miami hotel , or her father will get killed . I wish to assert that the airplane setting really heightens the tension . Even creepier is how Jack gets everyone to like him , so Lisa probably can't blow his cover . If the movie has any problem , it's the actual assassins : why do they have to be Russians ? Aren't we done portraying Russians as killers / Mafiosos / oligarchs ? But overall , I really liked this movie . Wes Craven brings the same sensibility that he brought to the rest of his movies . So check it out . You're sure to like it . . . and it just might save your life .
406819	865972	84719	10.0	Truly nasty and sadistic Lucio Fulci's thriller .	Lucio Fulci's " The New York Ripper " ( 1982 ) is a very sleazy and nasty thriller filled with sadistic sexual violence and gore . A sicko killer is on the loose in New York City . He enjoys slicing up young and beautiful women , preferably naked ones . He also talks like a duck and likes to taunt police . Lieutant Williams ( Jack Hedley ) tries to find him . Like all good gialli " The New York Ripper " is an uniquely crafted mystery with plenty of red herrings . The film is extremely brutal-women are graphically gutted , Zora Kerova ( " Cannibal Ferox " ) has a broken bottle rammed into her vagina , another woman has her erect nipple , then eye slowly slashed by a razor blade . It also features more sex and sleaze than any other Fulci film I can recall for example one scene takes place in a 42nd Street strip club , where a man and woman engage in live sex on stage in front of an audience . All in all " The New York Ripper " is a cult classic and a must-see for fans of Italian giallos . So if you liked this one I'd recommend " Giallo a Venezia " , " The Killer Is Still Among Us " , " Born for Hell " , " House on the Edge of the Park " , " Maniac " , " Terror Express " and other nasty movies from the golden times of exploitation !
483251	1293485	377092	9.0	Predictable , but I loved it	Honestly , I wasn't expecting too much . I thought " It's probably just another teen movie " . But it had a lot of laughs and fun jokes . I am becoming more impressed with Lindsay Lohan as an actress . I think she is extremely talented . The movie also just reminded me so much of my old high school . Everyone was so separated in their own groups , and everyone always wonders how does the popular girl get popular if everyone hates her ? I really enjoyed this movie . I thought it was very funny and enjoyable . Although it is a little predictable , trust me , you'll still get a lot of laughs from " Mean Girls " .
504817	2911571	250617	8.0	excellent but not exactly uplifting	This is an excellent film that was evidently made on a low budget but still comes off very well . A man , just released from prison , finds out his old partner has gone straight and has a real job . Considering that these guys have to be about 60 or so that's probably not a bad thing . When these two guys get back to town they go to the Golden Eagle , an extremely run-down old hotel in the heart of L . A . , and populated by hookers , pensioners , and various crazy folks . Here the one man reveals to his recently released buddy that he has two tickets to Vegas and they're heading out in the morning to start new lives . Too bad his buddy isn't too smart and ends up killing a hooker in the hotel room while he's out getting beer & pork rinds . Of course at this point things are no longer looking up and they have to figure out what to do with the body so no one will trace it back to them . Several side stories include a young hooker-in-training , a crazy old man who claims to have tag-teamed Fay Wray with Bela Lugosi , and various others . This is a very strong movie but it's also quite depressing , so not a nominee for " feel good movie of the year ' . An excellent movie of the seedy side of life . .
428177	3079504	38937	1.0	One of the worst Vincent Price movies	This isn't going to be a review , rather its simply an expression of displeasure at film that wasted a couple hours of my life . Half way through the first and only time I ever watched this movie I vowed never to watch it again . Several years later I have been true to my word . I have kept the video tape of this movie so that I could know that I always had the choice to watch this if I found that chewing tin foil lost its thrill . So far there have been only two Vincent price films which I found such a waste of time that I never wanted to see them again , this was one and The Bat , was the other . I really don't know why I find this movie so distasteful , but I do . Its simply one of those things that rubbed me the wrong way . I can't recommend it , not can I recommend chewing tin foil , but if you must choose one choose the foil .
564553	102816	34806	7.0	I never knew corn was so . . . important	This animated short was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Short Subject . Quite right as I found it very informative . It details the history of corn . Yes , a strange subject indeed , but apparently without the Native American ' invention ' of corn on the cob , we'd have precious little of the products and medicines we'd have today . Produced in co-operation with the Canadian film board I believe this was made to educate the masses on corn ( for some reason ) . Why the Canadian government felt the need to do this back in 1942 is anyone's guess but it's still a neat little documentary . You'll find it in the Disney Treasures : On the Front Lines DVD set .

" The young boy who voiced " Wilbur , " Dominic Scott Kay ( who gets no film credit on the back of the DVD even though he has the most lines , and gets 11th listing on the cast page here on IMDb ) gives us some facts and figures and takes us behind the scenes with the training of the animals . We talks as if he is explaining things to other kids but there are many interesting facts are animals that adults can learn a lot , too . What's " amazing , " Dominic's favorite word , is to see a sheep shaking hands , like a dog would be trained , or a pig walking backwards on command , and a few other things . Animal trainers are pretty special , patient people as we see here . Dominic also shares some very interesting facts about pigs and spiders that most people probably don't know , such as why pigs love the mud and that spiders eat their webs to help make new ones . The answer to the pigs and mud is : 1 - to protect their pale skin from sunburn ; 2 - to cool off , because they don't have sweat glands , and 3 - to protect against biting flies .
419477	1609079	493075	4.0	This is what happens when you swallow some bull !	Here's a film within a film ! In 1907 , the Gaumont Films company in France made a slapstick comedy ( silent , of course ) with a title that would translate from the French as ' A gentleman who ate some bull ' . I'm aware of at least one ( incomplete ) print of that original film , which was screened in October 2007 at the silent-movie festival in Pordenone , Italy . That print is in Australia's National Sound and Film Archive . In 1933 , a Ukrainian named Eugene Deslow got hold of that film - - not the Australian print , though - - and added an introduction plus a soundtrack , the latter consisting of commentary narrated by the single-named actor Bétove . ( A possible pun on ' Beethoven ' ? ) I'll describe the original 1907 movie first before getting to that narration . A Parisian hostess serves her dinner guests a dish containing bull-flesh . It goes down a treat for everyone except one particular gent . ( He must be a Taurus . ) Conveniently , there are a pair of cattle horns on the hostess's wall ; this man takes them down , attaches them to his forehead , and begins pawing the carpet as if he were a bull . He charges the hostess and her maid , terrifies the guests , wrecks the house and then rushes out into the street , where he terrorises the neighbours . Well , we all know that the best bullfighters come from Spain . There aren't many Montmartre matadors . A telegrapher sends an urgent message to Madrid : calling all bull-fighters ! A veritable parade of matadors come poncing through the streets of Paris , ready to do battle with the bull-man . SPOILER NOW . After a slapstick bullfight , he is subdued and arrested . Apart from the bizarre premise , there are some interesting visual compositions here . It's very strange ( and funny ) to see a whole squadron of bull-fighters marching through the streets . Most impressive is the sequence in the telegrapher's office . Here we see some early stop-motion animation , as each of the letters of the Morse code transmission ( in French ) appears on strings ( telegraph wires ? ) suspended across the top of the set . Now , the 1933 version : Deslaw clearly wanted to put his imprint on this footage , but the result is not entirely a success . As I listened to Deslaw's wise-cracking commentary ( voiced sarcastically by Bétove ) , I was reminded of those 1960s silent-film compilations by Robert Youngson , in which Youngson substituted his own comments for the original title cards . I was also reminded of ' MSFT3K ' : a series which I despise , in which a couple of clever-dicks make fun of the previous crude efforts of film-makers who did the best they could . It's a VERY cheap shot to ridicule a 1907 film for its crudity , but that's basically what Deslaw is doing here . I'll rate the original 1907 film : this 1933 reworking rates barely a 4 .

But when they get there the brother and his friends are nowhere to be found . They soon clash with demented ( possibly demoniacally infected ) locals . The acting was serviceable if nothing special , the mere fact that this is a low-budget film , i can ignore that . What I couldn't ignore was the lack of good lighting were a good portion of the movie or the reliance on shaky-cam shots during the action scenes of the film . Or , for that matter , the surprising lack of gore . What we're left with is a somewhat boring travelogue of Mexican scenery for a good part of the movie and inane banter .

429862	1173088	116240	5.0	What's the point ?	I don't understand the point of this movie . " Terms of Endearment " already did all this - and it was better . What's the point of bringing Shirley MacLaine back almost fifteen years later ? The original audience of the first film are much older by then and younger girls don't give a damn because they weren't around when the original was released . Do you see a point ? Neither do I . Perhaps that's why it flopped when it came out . MacLaine returns to her role and basically this movie is just her life and we get an update on how she's living . Juliette Lewis and Bill Paxton get little to do - Lewis is annoying as usual and frankly I wouldn't mind if she just stopped acting permanently tomorrow . The best thing about this film has to be Jack's cameo appearance as Garrett . It almost saves a failing movie - but once he leaves it all falls apart again .

513093	3223254	308476	10.0	Three People Beyond Words : Communication !	THE CUCKOO ( Kukushka ) is a small miracle of a film . It is not only a unique story but one that draws us into the individual lives of three people form different languages and backgrounds who bond in time of war because of their mutual isolation . It is at once charming , gently humorous , and deeply touching . Taking place during WW II during the little known Russo-Finnish War , the setting is Lapland . We first encounter a Finnish student / soldier Veikko ( Ville Haapasalo ) being chained by the Russians to a rock in a German SS uniform as punishment for his disillusionment in the war effort , thinking that he will be killed as the enemy . In another area some Russian soldiers are transporting a Russian poet / soldier Ivan ( Viktor Bychkov ) condemned for his anti-Communist stance : the jeep transporting Ivan is bombed , killing the soldiers except for Ivan . Along comes a little Lapp girl Anni ( Anni-Kristiina Juuso ) , finds the severely injured Ivan , drags him to her hut and nurses him back to health . Meanwhile Veikko ingeniously frees himself from his rock and wanders into the presence of Anni . Veikko speaks Finnish , Ivan speaks Russian and Anni ( aka ' Cuckoo ' ) speaks Sami and the three cannot understand each other's language or customs . Ivan sees Veikko as a fascist and wants to destroy him ; Veikko never wanted to be in the war anyway so he pacifies Ivan ; Anni is more concerned with basic physical needs ( her husband has been gone four years , conscripted by the armed forces for a war she doesn't understand and she is hungry for the presence of a man in her bed ! ) . The story explains the manner in which these three people intertwine their lives and beliefs and overcome the barriers of language to form a trio of true universal family . The war ends and the three ' bodies ' separate , leaving behind indelible evidence of their transforming experiences . Writer / director Aleksandr Rogozhkin has created a masterpiece , a film brimming with beauty of visuals , of warmly humorous exchanges of dialog understood only by each speaker , of survival and of the mystery of life beyond . The acting is superb , the cinematography is breathtaking , and the message is deeply moving . In the field of strong anti-war statements , THE CUCKOO is the most sincere . A brilliant achievement !

504988	2911571	475984	8.0	Strange , sometimes beautiful , and will haunt you afterward	I wanted to see this in the theater when it was released , but unfortunately it didn't play around here , and really , I didn't know it was out on DVD either till I stumbled across a used copy at my favorite local store . This is a very strange film for Harmony Korinne , almost more strange than " Gummo " or " Julien Donkey Boy " , but , perhaps in a different way . The film features a very eclectic cast , including two veterans of " Performance " ( James Fox & Anita Pallenberg ) , Werner Herzog , and a cast of lesser known French and English actors , and also , Diego Luna . The story is that of a young man ( Luna ) who is a Michael Jackson impersonator , but he doesn't exactly get " out of character " . He's seen performing on the streets of Paris for pocket change . . . although no one seems very interested . He appears to just be squeaking by in life . At a performance at an retirement home , he meets a Marilyn Monroe impersonator , who he encounters later , only to find that she's married to a Charlie Chaplin impersonator , has a daughter that's a Shirley Temple impersonator , and they're all part of a commune in Scotland . They have no " Michael " though , so he's invited to come live with them . So Michael goes with Marilyn ( Samantha Morton ) and becomes part of this little community , which includes a foul-mouthed Abe Lincoln , The Three Stooges , Queen Elizabeth ( Pallenberg ) , The Pope ( Fox ) , Little Red Riding Hood ( Korinne's wife ) , Madonna , and even Buckwheat . Despite the fact that these people seem to inhabit fantasy worlds , life goes on and things have to be done that are unpleasant , like having to kill their sheep because of disease , etc . The little commune puts together a stage show which they spend a lot of time on , and invite all the locals to come to " The Greatest Show on Earth " , and while it's all very heartfelt there are few people who attend . Tragedy strikes when one of their members decide that life is too hard and they can't go on anymore , after which Michael returns to Paris and his old life , only to find that his friends have " come with him " . As a subplot , Herzog is a priest who is also a pilot , and he has witnessed a miracle as one nun fell from the plane as they were dropping food to the needy , only to survive her fall . The nuns of this order then begin to jump from the plane and survive , and have been invited to the Vatican for an audience with the ( real ) Pope . Unfortunately they're unable to escape the irony of real life . This is a haunting , beautiful , and very weird film , probably best appreciated by those familiar with Korinne's work , but others may find it fascinating as well . I found myself actually caring about the characters , and there's a few very touching moments , which is kind of different for Korinne . I'd highly recommend this . .

After finding them he confronts Casey about them , Casey tells him its for his own good although he hates the conversations about sandwiches Chuck has with Morgan . Chuck is also up for an assistant manager position at Buy More and tells Morgan to grow up . Morgan enlists the help of Devon ( " Capt . Awesome " ) . As he bonds with Laszlo watching James Bond movies , Chuck's unaware of how dangerous Laszlo really is . . . That conversation about sandwiches on a deserted island that irks Casey so much is a highlight of the episode as is the whole costume party that climaxes the hour with Chuck and Morgan really bonding over the annual Dune sandworm outfit they always dress in at this time of Halloween . I recognized a fellow agent that appears here as Samantha's superior on " Samantha Who ? " last week . He sure is one strange looking dude ! Also loved the whole scene of Awesome telling Morgan to tuck his shirt as a way of acting more mature . Looks like they really are trying to make him a little less irritating though I still loved when he revealed to Ellie's boyfriend that when he was 12 , he stayed under the bed to look at her undress ! Hope the ratings pick up this week !
469445	1532177	462071	5.0	What Was Missing Is More Important Than What Was Included	I have to worry about these channel 4 list shows . They seem to be produced at an alarming rate while there doesn't seem to be any genre left for a 100 GREATEST list show anymore . Can we please now bury these schedule fillers ? As with all the other 100 GREATEST shows I found myself agreeing with some of the listings while passionately disagreeing with most of what was included . There were some heartwarming moments where films received the recognition they deserved such as the criminally underrated CROSS OF IRON at 37 which I rate as the greatest war movie set during the second world war ( Though the reviewer David Aaronovitch shows he has no idea what he's talking about when he describes the villain as " A Nazi officer " Schell's villain is clearly stated as being a Prussian aristocrat opposed to egalitarian Nazi ideals ) , and we see a couple of very deserved top ten placings for ZULU ( 8 ) and A BRIDGE TOO FAR ( 7 ) but much of the problem with this chart is what qualifies as a " war film " I mean at number 100 we have FIRST BLOOD . Is John Rambo shooting up a redneck town a war movie ? If that's classed as a war movie then why not include DOG SOLDIERS or 28 DAYS LATER ( The soundtrack for 28DL is played between segments ) since they have battle scenes with soldiers , and are movies like TROY and BRAVEHEART war films ? But it's what wasn't included that made my heart sink . Thankfully we didn't get garbage like THE GREEN BERETS , PEARL HARBOR and OBJECTIVE BURMA but the list was missing well regarded - Well regarded by prolific critics at least - movies like THE BRIDGE AT REMAGEN , DER UNTERGANG , TOO LATE THE HERO , LOST COMMAND , THE BLUE MAX and SAVIOR . Perhaps the most ridiculous non inclusion is J'ACCUSE ! a movie that was filmed during the first world war that used real French soldiers as extras many of whom were later killed in battle . Are we to use this list as a definitive survey as to what the greatest war movies ever made are ? Of course not and you do get the impression that a great number of people voted for the last war film they saw . As for the top five they were : 1 ) SAVING PRIVATE RYAN 2 ) APOCALYPSE NOW 3 ) THE GREAT ESCAPE 4 ) SCHINDLER'S LIST 5 ) FULL METAL JACKET I've always thought SPR was very overrated and is so well regarded due to Spielberg's technical achievements in the first 20 minutes and last 15 minutes of the movie but most of the story is composed of Uncle Sam winning the second world war single handed . Mind you it's amazing to see channel 4 conduct a 100 GREATEST list that wasn't won by THE SIMPSONS

385803	391152	320661	4.0	Weak Crusades epic by Ridley Scott	Scott has an undeserved reputation , mostly based on just a couple of movies ( Alien and Blade Runner ) , and it doesn't surprise me that this movie is so unimpressive . It makes Gladiator , a decent film , look like it deserved to win the Best Picture Oscar . Orlando Bloom stars . A lot of negative stuff has been said about him , but , truth be told , I don't think he's that bad an actor . He's a perfect matinée idol , and Pirates of the Caribbean suits him well . He's poor in Kingdom of Heaven , but I wouldn't blame him . His role is underwritten . His character , Balian , is a French blacksmith who discovers that he is the illegitimate son of a great warrior . He then travels to Jerusalem , where Christians have held fort for the past century . Through dirty dealings on the Christians ' side , the Muslims , lead by Saladin , attempt to take Jerusalem back . There is little that is worthwhile . The battle scenes have all been done better in other movies . I guess after Return of the King , nothing much is going to compare . The references to modern politics are sparse and very poorly integrated . Troy did this much better last year . It criticizes hardcore Christianity to some extent , but really these are only petty barbs . The attitudes of the characters feel completely anachronistic . Besides a couple of scummy priests , religion is barely present . Morality is completely modernized . The only reason I had interest in seeing this movie was because it is Eva Green's second role . Her first was in Bertolucci's The Dreamers . Her screen presence is hard to argue with , but I think she is a gifted young actress and I hope she will go onto better things . She is completely wasted in Kingdom of Heaven .
464128	2467618	871009	5.0	It looks less like a short film and more like a proposal for a TV series	This is a short film that really looks much more like a proposal for a television series . While the WHY is never answered , the film is a bit like a Black version of THE FUGITIVE with a twist . The twist is that the guy DID do something bad , though you never find out exactly what . It seems that he'd been a cop for some time but had " gone bad " and was tossed off the force . Perhaps for masochistic reasons , he refuses to leave town and the police make his life very , very miserable . While the basic idea is pretty good , I couldn't help but think that the leading man looked too young and just didn't sound like a cop . In addition , without knowing what all the events were taking place , I felt a bit frustrated and felt the thing ended too quickly . Still , there is a good story idea there and perhaps it could be worked into something bigger .
400972	7743887	398559	10.0	" I think we'd best leave this one open , John ! "	Reviewing archive television programmes , it is hard to avoid using the phrase " this could not possibly be made now " . ' Second Verdict ' , shown on B . B . C . - 1 in the summer of 1976 ( phew ! what a scorcher that was ! ) is a fine example of a programme that ' could not possibly be made now ' . Though screened in peak-time , it basically consisted of a pair of middle-aged men talking a lot while confined to one room . Can you imagine it being commissioned now ? Anyone foolish enough to entertain the notion would be told to go and have a lie down . The trick was that the men in question were Frank Windsor and the late Stratford Johns , reprising their roles as ' Det . Chief . Supt . Charlie Barlow ' and ' Det . Chief . Supt . John Watt ' from the crime dramas ' Softly , Softly ' and ' Z-Cars ' . Over six weeks , they re-opened the files of some of the world's most baffling criminal cases , such as the Lindbergh kidnappings and the murders of the Princes in the Tower by King Richard 111 . The ' pilot ' was a 1973 programme about Jack The Ripper . Though Barlow and Watt failed to work out just who did do it , it was fascinating watching them at work . They would state all the known facts , attempt to work out how the crimes were committed , usually with the help of specially staged reconstructions , and bring their not inconsiderable detective skills to bear by challenging the verdicts . It was like a television version of ' Sleuth ' . Johns and Windsor were a great team , and watching the duo spar was a treat . Sadly , the show had one major flaw . With the exception of the final episode - ' Who Burned Down The Reichstag ? ' - no actual second verdicts were forthcoming . The evidence was just not there . Johns said in an interview at the time : " I did not like the title . It was too limiting . I would have preferred ' Second Opinion ' . " . Another problem was that I . T . V . had a similar show on air at that time . ' Killers ' featured detailed reconstructions of notorious crime trials , with much of the dialogue based on transcripts . According to Brian Lawrence , television critic of The News Of The World : " ' Killers ' makes ' Second Verdict ' look sick ! " . Whatever its faults , the B . B .

To leave it gathering dust on a shelf for all time would itself be a crime .
366803	3109237	50118	6.0	" Man Lives Through Plutonium Blast "	During a plutonium bomb test , Lt . Col . Glenn Manning ( Glenn Langan ) finds himself in the open and absorbs much of the force of the blast . Even though 95 % of the skin on his body is burnt away , the bomb doesn't kill him . Doctors work tirelessly to keep him alive . Miraculously and in no time at all , not only is Manning out of danger , his body seems completely healed ? no burns and no scars . Surely the plutonium had something to do with Manning's recovery . But what other side effects does Manning face form his plutonium exposure ? As Manning begins a slow but steady growth to gargantuan proportions , the side effects become quite obvious . Bert I . Gordon made a lot of movies that can best be described as trash . I might have a good time with them , but I realize there not very good . That's not the case with The Amazing Colossal Man . I honestly think it's a decent enough movie . I realize that my judgment may be clouded by the fact that this is one of the very first movies I remember seeing . There's no accounting for nostalgia . And , I realize that today some of my enjoyment comes from scenes that fit the " so bad it's good " definition ( Manning's trip to Las Vegas and the giant hypodermic needle obviously come to mind ) , but there are other moments that work for me as intended . For example , I think Manning's descent in to madness is well done . Whatever the reason , I find more good , enjoyable moments in The Amazing Colossal Man than I do bad , dull moments and have no trouble rating the movie a . But please , don't take my rating as some sort of recommendation . There are too many problems that even I can see for me to tout The Amazing Colossal Man as a " must see " . If you decide to give it chance , don't blame me if you don't immediately move it into your top ten . To begin with , the special effects are weak ? not only by today's standards , but by the standards of 1957 . The rear projection scenes are quite badly done . In addition , some of the acting is just as bad as the special effects . Other than Langan , no one in the cast comes out looking very good . Finally , the movie is full of padding . The Amazing Colossal Man may only be 80 minutes in length , but a good part of the runtime is taken by Dr . Linstrom ( William Hudson ) spouting scientific theories at any given opportunity . My favorite is the " single cell " heart theory . And to make the padding even more obvious , he repeats the same scientific mumbo-jumbo on more than one occasion .
509547	453068	78841	10.0	a biting black comedy of a detached character in a particular state of mind	Being There will get you thinking about what it means to be taken in by television , as well as the government , and the better ( or lesser ) intentions of people in power , and works on more than one level . It's a pure slice of oddball life , the story of a man who got more than likely tucked away into some kind of perfunctory manner by the only things in life with any significance being television and gardening . No more or less . How does one end up living out in the world , however , if this is all there is for the span of a long life ? Jerzy Kosinski's idea is to place this fragmented , polite but assuredly clueless fellow where double standards rule the day . He meets a businessman after a limo accident , and by his outward appearance seeming to fit a certain mold he takes him in . The man is connected in his dealings , all the way up to the president , as an adviser . All Chance ( Peter Sellers ) can do is say what he knows - not only does he not know lies or how to lie , he's been sort of conditioned , in a way , to not fully comprehend good and evil either . But his words carry meaning , somehow , and he becomes a celebrity all the while not really connected to what's going on . Rarely before has detachment and the subtleties of the human condition been this engaging . There are three major factors for this , which is the control of wit and truth in the screenplay by Kosinski , who won't go for the cheapest laughs or too mocking in satirical form , but in the moments of dead-pan exchange and the bluntness of Chance's character . Sellers , of course , is at the very top of his game , and that's a first factor , along with the rest of the excellent cast ( MacClaine is maybe at her best , as I've not seen too much that wowed me until now ; Douglass gives a compassionate performance that speaks to the issue of illness and the end of existence ; Warden is surprisingly adept at playing a flabbergasted , weak-willed president ) . He leads it as if going for something that seems like it shouldn't be interesting . It's a guy who doesn't really have much expression , aside from some bits of joy , like meeting the president , or in becoming ( somewhat ) part of MacClaine's character's love-life , or in seeing someone die . But even then it's a muted , half-way expression , and the repression that Sellers makes real here is staggering . The term ' comfortably numb ' popped in my head once or twice regarding Chance the gardener , and Sellers makes this as real as possible , and sometimes as funny as possible , but for the most part it's his most mature work where there isn't any cheating - what you see , with his mind transmogrified by TV forever - is what you get . Ashby , meanwhile , makes this a very successfully directed film by putting a tone to the picture that is not really like the Chance character because you want to see where he goes next . He'll put in a sequence that is hysterically funny , like when Chance is in the limo watching the Cheech and Chong bit Basketball Jones , or in Chance's reaction to pure sexual advances from MacClaine , or in several little things . But he also makes it on a bedrock of a level of plausibility , at least in some part . It's doubtful if a man would have this sort of effect on a mass public , once appearing in public anyway , and have his words 100 % to heart , because there would be over-analysis and eventually a crack in the whole character's intent that gardening tactics are universal . And yet it's even more plausible , however , to see what effect words do have when taken out of context AS the context , and how perceptions in America create more than what one might bargain for , and eventually become a mantra of sorts . That Chance also is quite a dim fellow - not a dimwit exactly , he's not necessarily stupid - brings some extra resonance in the political swamp of today . Ashby times all of this as though he were certain when to just let the everyday come in as something more . He puts in great musical choices , and a few very memorable images ( I loved the shot of Chance walking on the middle-road to the Capital building ) , and crowns it with a screenplay that doesn't , unlike TV for Chance , take things too simple . Not that there isn't almost a silent-film whimsy to this all , but there's so much to Being There that it will stick with you for many days afterwords .
533104	70535	109402	5.0	At least it was aptly named . . . it offered little else	Why is Hollywood still turning out these films ? Absolutely nothing new in this noisy kaleidoscope of speeding cars , exploding trucks and choppers , and swearing policemen . The gags would have proven funny 30 years ago , but are old hat today . I did like the frozen cadaver sequence , however . The ending of this picture was pat and predictable ; good entertainment for pre-teens or the partially brain dead .
499086	1355507	117011	5.0	Strictly average JCVD action thriller .	Maximum Risk starts in the South of France where ex-Russian mobster Mikhail Suverov ( Jean-Claude Van Damme ) is killed in an accident while trying to escape from two FBI agents chasing him . The police become involved & detective Sebastien ( Jean-Hugues Anglade ) recognises Mikhail as his close friend & fellow cop Alain Moreau ( Jean-Claude Van Damme ) , it quickly turns out that Mikhail & Alain were identical twins separated at birth . Wanting to know about his brother & why he was killed Alain follows a trail back to New York where he discovers his brother Mikhail was involved with Russian mobsters & a beautiful waitress named Alex Minetti ( Natasha Henstridge ) , Alain also discovers the Russian mobsters want him dead not to mention the FBI who also want a piece of him . . . Making his American action film debut this run of the mill JCVD action film was directed by Ringo Lam & was the second time a famed Asian action film director made his American feature film debut with JCVD after John Woo made probably JCVD's best film Hard Target ( 1993 ) & JCVD would also star in Hark Tsui's first American film as well with the terrible Double Team ( 1997 ) . Anyway , here the almost humourless script by Larry Ferguson feels like a collection of action film clichés loosely strung together with little regard for a plot , the narrative or the audience . There's the JCVD character who is not only a cop but also an ex-soldier just so he can really handle himself , there's evil mobsters who can't shoot straight , there's a pretty blonde woman who is entirely surplus to the plot & is included solely for her looks , there's various fights & chases , there's a ' big ' tough bad guy who JCVD has to have a climatic showdown with towards the end , there's crooked FBI agents & not much of a plot to speak of . Most of Maximum Risk just feels like JCVD going from one fight to another on the basic pretence that they are after his twin brother & it just gets old very quickly & the whole plot is uninspiring , it's predictable , it's silly & it's throughly routine . I suppose it's watchable , there's nothing spectacularly wrong with it & it moves along at a decent pace but I just can't muster up much enthusiasm for it at all & I consider myself a JCVD fan . Maximum Risk was the second time JCVD played dual roles in a film the first being Double Impact ( 1991 ) where , like in Maximum Risk , he played identical twins & then he went on to play two roles in both Replicant ( 2001 ) & The Order ( 2001 ) . Having said that his twin dies in the opening sequence so there are never two JCVD's on screen at once in Maximum Risk . I have to say that I didn't like the way Maximum Risk was shot at all , the fact I saw a pan and scan version rather than a full 2 : 35 : 1 widescreen edition didn't help but the camera angles are weird & they just don't capture the action that well , the length of shot is very short & the editing is just very bad & annoying as it makes it difficult so get a grip of what is going on & finally there's that horrible shaky camera syndrome which just adds to the general irritation . The action feels routine , the fights are alright but nothing special while the chases are ruined by being poorly shot & aren't much to begin with anyway . Also what does Lam have against plastic garden furniture ? The amount of scenes in which he crashes cars into plastic chairs & tables outside cafés seems to be too numerous to be a coincidence . With a supposed budget of about $25 , 000 , 000 Maximum Risk really should have been better than this , I think it's a throughly routine & badly shot action flick that apart from one or two car chases & some expensive location work looks like it was a made-for-telly effort . The locations sound impressive having been shot in Paris , Canada & New York . The acting is poor , I think JCVD is terrible in this while all the Russian accents are unconvincing although at least Hanstridge is easy on the eyes & she goes topless briefly in one scene . Maximum Risk is one of JCVD's more routine efforts , I found it a really disappointing film that was badly shot & written . Having said that it passes the time & is nowhere near his worst although at the same time it's nowhere near his best . After several big hits like Universal Soldier ( 1992 ) , Hard Target , Timecop ( 1994 ) & Sudden Death ( 1995 ) you can trace the demise of JCVD pretty much back to Maximum Risk .
417499	663392	44419	8.0	Outstanding Film Classic	Once I see the name Howard Hawks , I know immediately the picture is going to be a great film with outstanding actors . Hawks produced such great films as : " Sergeant York " , ' 41 ; " Red River " , ' 48 ; Gentlemen Prefer Blondes " , ' 53 along with many other great film Classics . Even though the film is in black and white , it still captures your imagination as to those early pioneer days and the desire for men to fight the many odds against them ; Indian attacks , fur traders and even a single female Indian Blackfoot , Elizabeth Threatt , ( Blackfoot Princess ) who managed to entertain the old timers and the young French bucks in the camp . Kirk Douglas , ( Jim Deakins ) , " The Bad & The Beautiful " , ' 53 , was very young looking and also slim and trim and was the star of the picture . However , Jim Deakins played a very low key role in this picture compared to all the veteran character actors , who gave the picture a great deal of depth . This is truly a great attempt of portraying the American Scene years ago . I almost forgot , the one and only gal in this picture , Elizabeth Threatt , gave her one and only performance in this film , I guess all those guys hitting on her in the film , made her decided to change her career in life real Fast !
366099	3109237	289250	2.0	Child abuse as entertainment	Man , how times have changed ! If you believe what you see in Junior Rodeo Daredevils , it seems that in the 1940s , any crazy stranger could take your kid , strap him / her to some sort of livestock , and watch them get thrown to the hard ground . Oh what fun - child abuse as entertainment ! What parent wouldn't want a broken neck or a ruptured spleen for their child ? Instead of being brought up on charges , Old-Timer Billy Slater gets to sit back and enjoy the sight of children having their necks snapped . It did my heart good to see this crazy old coot laugh like a hyena as one child after the next received severe head trauma . Yes , Junior Rodeo Daredevils is certainly one of the most demented sights I've ever seen . Mystery Science Theater 3000 did a wonderful job with this short . The riffing possibilities were abundant and the guys took full advantage . Much of it is laugh-out-loud funny . On my MST3K rating scale , Junior Rodeo Daredevils gets a .
513084	3223254	422295	8.0	Artists Taking Risks	The division of opinion in responses to FUR - AN IMAGINARY PORTRAIT OF DIANE ARBUS is a healthy one and it is reassuring to read so many fine views of the film's worth . Diane Arbus remains one of the more important artists of the 20th century , a woman who defied societal taboos and entered the world of the marginal people - fellow human beings whose genetic inheritances could be viewed as either curses or variations of normal . Without making judgments Arbus photographed little people and giants , people with less than four limbs , people with deformities both skeletal and flesh defined , people whose life styles influenced at times grotesque appearances : in the end the common denominator is ' people ' . She was unafraid to observe and to capture nature's variations . How this great artist transitioned from the ordinary life of the ' proper wife and mother ' of the 1950s to the world of the bizarre has always been a story that begged to be told . In this film , loosely based on the biography by Patricia Bosworth as adapted by Erin Cressida Wilson , driven director Steven Shainberg strives to create a story that would explain the transition . It is only a story and to judge it as honest biography would be incorrect . It is fantasy and one that is a clever , if overdone , explanation for Arbus ' choices she made in her private life and in her artistic life . As Diane Arbus , Nicole Kidman once again inhabits the role of a very strange personality and does it so well that she manages to take us along the odd journey on which she embarks . Her nice but mundane husband Allan ( Ty Burrell ) allows her to explore the presence of a new tenant Lionel ( Robert Downey Jr . ) , encouraging his frustrated wife to take up photography on her own rather than serving as his assistant for the fashion magazine images he grinds out . Lionel is covered with hair ( hypertrichosis ) and as a sideshow freak has many friends who have deformities . Arbus enters this world , loves the freedom of expression she has longed for , and in time falls in love with Lionel , leaving her family to enter completely the vision she has discovered ( this is not a spoiler as the film opens with this information ) . Yes , Shainberg can be criticized for excess and for pushing the boundaries of credibility , but for this viewer that approach enhances the concept of visualizing the epiphany in an artist's life when the world changes to a form the artist can then capture and share . The sets , photography , and the acting fit the idea - even the far too prolonged love scene / body shaving sequence and aftermath that can only be described as bizarre . The film is obviously a work of love and one that honors the life of Diane Arbus , even though we are not given much true information about the woman . Veteran actors Jane Alexander and Harry Yulin add to the dignity of the project , as does a fascinatingly simple musical score by Carter Burwell . This is a film for those who appreciate fantasy as a means of relating a history : for those who need factual biographical approach this film will not appeal . Grady Harp
416314	663392	40495	8.0	Oscar Winning Film	A truly great film with a very fantastic story about a deaf / mute young girl named Belinda McDonald , ( Jane Wyman ) who lives with her father Black McDonald , ( Charles Bickford ) and Aggie McDonald , ( Agnes Moorehead ) who live on a farm and work very hard to make a living . Belinda is called a dummy by most of the people in town until a Dr . Robert Richardson , ( Lew Ayres ) meets her and decides to teach her sign language and is able to communicate with her and other people . Unfortunately , a cruel person rapes Belinda and she becomes pregnant and that is when the story becomes very interesting and the story takes on many twists and turns . Agnes Moorehead gave an outstanding supporting role along with Stephen McNally , ( Locky McCormick ) . This is a great Academy Award Winning Film from 1948 . Enjoy .
532874	70535	62467	7.0	Don't wait until dark to see this one	Terrifying look at how innocent lives can be changed with one simple chance meeting . Why Susie didn't just give the doll back as soon as she found it is beyond me . The hoods would have fought it out for the loot and maybe killed each other . Then again , perhaps one of them would have returned anyway . Very effective movie , much scarier than many of the splatter movies so popular lately , especially the last few minutes . Good acting from the entire cast ; I particularly enjoyed all the devious facial expressions by Crenna and Weston .
420572	2542703	111503	8.0	True Lies is True to Form	An exciting action-packed film with Arnold S doing a great imitation of a married James Bond . The action sequences are phenomenal here . There are many chase scenes and the ending scenes with the airplane hovering around Florida are absolutely awesome . As the supposed computer salesman but really a CIA agent , Arnold is quite convincing in the role . Had he gotten parts like this , he could have stayed in the movies and California would be having another governor now . Jamie Lee Curtis is just perfect as the plain-Jane wife who is drawn into Arnold's way of life when she is recruited by an agent of the enemy . Tom Arnold is in perform form in a supporting role as Arnold's sidekick . The story can be silly when Harry ( Arnold ) suspects his wife of having an affair , but does it pick up when the action and storyline of a terrorist plot to hurt America is brought to life .
422920	2248099	416320	8.0	A change of environment proves lucky for Woody Allen	Every film that Woody Allen releases is automatically a point of interest for me , especially when the film in question has won itself a lot of favourable reviews . Match Point sees Allen in new territory as his beloved New York has been swapped for London , England . Despite this relocation , however , Match Point is still very clearly a Woody Allen film . The film is mostly a romantic drama , but as the story moves forward ; thriller elements start to creep through , and best of all we get a very potent streak of black humour to round things off . The plot typically features the central character in turmoil . We are introduced to former tennis star turned coach , Chris Wilton . He's looking for a meaning to his life and wants to do something different from tennis . After meeting a man named Tom , Chris finds himself the object of Tom's sister Chloe's affections . However , our tennis star has his eyes on Tom's finance ; Nola . After having an affair with Nola , Chris finds himself at decision-making time . Because as we all know ; you can't have two women for long . The film starts off with a sequence in which the protagonist tells us about a tennis ball hitting the top of a net during a game . If it carries on going , your luck is in ; but if it falls back , it isn't . Woody Allen keeps this luck theme going throughout the film , and the way that he harks back to the opening scene towards the end of the film is just great . Being from the UK myself , I was interested to see how Allen would handle the London setting . I've got to say , however , that I'm a bit upset about the fact that he has decided to set the film in the upper crust of society . It's not so difficult for me to relate to upper class New York because I'm not from America ; but as far as I'm concerned , the environment seen in this film doesn't really exist . . . but at least the English characters have English accents . The acting is fine , with Jonathan Rhys Meyers doing well in the lead role and hitting all the right notes as his character changes his stripes later on . Scarlett Johansson is his opposite number and delivers an emotional portrayal as the put-upon mistress , while Emily Mortimer is suitably posh to round off the central threesome . I loved the way the tale climaxes and I'm glad that Allen didn't continue along the lines that many films of this nature are happy to stay between . Overall , I can't say that this is Allen's best effort ; but it's a very good one , and the director has been showing good consistency over the last few years .
520874	1162550	374526	7.0	Among the top tier as far as fan films go	Hearing constant kudos and praise for this short fan film , my interest was piqued . Just being a fan film that one of the few that is NOT about Star Wars is enough to recommend it . Seeing Batman take on an alien as well as Predators is fun in an ultra geeky way and for the money spent , it IS quite a nice looking and polished film . On a whole , I did enjoy it . The one thing that didn't work for me in the least was the casting of Boner from " Growing Pains " as the Joker . Listen , the guy has had NO work since that show for a reason . He just can not act and brings the short to a grinding halt almost before it truly begins . But as I said , it's a huge nerdy Geekgasm after the Joker is out of the picture .
510607	453068	57261	8.0	some of the most memorable child acting outside of a musical or comedy	I was one of a handful of kids who didn't get to read Lord of the Flies at the time when it would've been most appropriate - back in grade school where I could relate to what is the quintessential story of boyhood Id gone amuck ( that is Id without any girls or parental guidance ) . So I had to be content with , years later , watching the film . It turns out to be something very fascinating ; very naturalistic ( the film was mostly improvised by its young cast ) and with breathtaking black and white cinematography . It's the classic story of a bunch of kids marooned on a deserted island with nothing but their wits and most barbaric instincts as young men ( emphasis on men , British no less ) , and what it is to be apart , or decidedly not part , of a herd . And while I wasn't completely blown away by the production , I could see the definite admiration for the source . As for the film , Peter Brook crafted something unique in that he got a bunch of kid actors , pretty much all of them first timers and non-professionals , and made them about as believable as can be possible in a drama . Aside from some other examples like Shoeshine or Stand by Me ( though the latter is more comedy / drama ) , Lord of the Flies showcases these young talents so much in a raw style , and often to heartbreaking and almost anthropological effect , that you can't take your eyes away from it . It's by now means flawless and occasionally suffers from its improvised expression of narrative , but the positive results are so strong it's kind of a sleeper must-see of the 1960s , at least in British cinema .
428542	3079504	960144	7.0	Amusing	Amusing Adam Sandler movie is a shift away from the serious films he's done of late back to the silliness of old . Actually not completely since the film is essentially a plea for everyone to get along . Zohan is an Israeli counter terrorist that is above all others . Tired of killing people he want to come to America to cut hair , a feeling made stronger when his arch rival whom he finally caught The terrorist named the Phantom , is revealed to have been traded for a low level spy and a spy to be named later . Faking his own death Zohan heads to America to live out his dream . Far from taxing this is an amusing , often low brow movie that is perfect for a rainy Sunday afternoon . The rapid fire jokes are more hit then miss which is a real plus . To be certain some of the film is stupid , but at the same time its good natured and forgivable . If there is any real flaw its the over use of the " I'm tired of fighting , can't we all get along " mantra . I appreciate the sentiment but at the same time by the second half I was full of the milk of human kindness and just wished that someone would do something funny . Definitely worth a look at some point , its one of the better Adam Sandler films .
368002	2707735	64155	6.0	" My brother's the only man alive who can call me an idiot . "	When I first saw Elvis in the film as the bearded desperado Jess Wade , I thought Wow ! - what if his career had taken a turn like , say , Clint Eastwood's . Elvis Presley as Rowdy Yates on ' Rawhide ' . Back when Elvis was lean and good looking , the independent wrangler approach might have taken him into spaghetti Westerns , and since he could also sing , one can only imagine the possibilities . As it is , Presley provides a fairly competent presence to his character in " Charro ! " , but as the film wears on , so does he . Though arguably one of his better films , it seems like the thrill is gone at a time in his career when ' The King ' was attempting a major comeback . The bearded face does indeed create an amazing transformation of the Elvis persona , and is one of the highlights of the picture . It doesn't go far enough though ; without achieving that flat out Lee Van Cleef mean , and matched against an adversary who's also less than sheer malevolence , the movie loses much of it's potential . The film's finale in fact seems to blow up as quickly as one of those cannon fired dynamite packets . When Vince Hackett ( Victor French ) falls apart and simply gives up , what the heck happened to Gunner ( James Sikking ) and Mody ( Charles H . Gray ) ? I mean , they just disappeared ! Then , as the town re-groups and Jess prepares for the trip to Mexico , Mrs . Ramsey ( Barbara Werle ) plants a kiss on him , when in just the prior scene she was ready to beat the snot out of him , blaming him for her husband's death ! How exactly did the reconciliation take place ? Even with the disconnects , it was cool seeing Paul Brinegar once again as Doc Opie ( there's that ' Rawhide ' connection again ) . Ina Balin , looking radiant and very much like a high school sweetheart , doesn't have much to do here as Presley's romantic interest , but even that seems wasted by the end of the story . Do you think he ever sent for her ? If for no other reason , " Charro ! " is worth seeing for a non characteristic look at Elvis Presley in a role that would have served much better at the beginning of his career than near it's end . But that's a whole other conversation . I wonder how Clint would have been in " Jailhouse Rock " .
398692	1391795	206314	7.0	Candy Cane ? Are You There ?	Nice-guy college student Lewis ( Paul Walker ) is going to his would-be girlfriend Venna's ( Leelee Sobieski ) college to drive her home and stops to bail his slacker brother Fuller ( Steve Zahn ) out of jail . Fuller soon coerces Lewis into playing a prank on a deep-voiced trucker using Lewis's CB radio . ( I didn't know they still made those things ! ) Since this is a chase thriller , it goes without saying that the prank produces horrifying results , and the trucker ends up pursuing Lewis and Fuller and Venna across the Southwest . Joy Ride's script does pose some questions ( How is it that Rusty Nail ( the trucker's CB handle ) is always able to know details about Lewis and Fuller , and where they are and what they are up to ? ) , but it's so well-made technically , exciting , and well-acted , that the script kind of takes a backseat to the film-makers's skills . ( That sequence in the hotel room IS kind of scary . ) You may be riveted in spite of yourself . One thing to comment on : both the video and DVD feature a 29-minute alternate ending that is worth checking out . Maybe some of you will actually prefer this ending , who knows ? I would give it .
403175	453228	713621	7.0	Not bad	Not bad . I hate shows that do not have a conclusion but tune in next week for the ending . this episode is like that . It leaves you hanging . Sometimes with TV series , the shows get bogged down with too many subplots . You didn't really learn much from part one . Maybe part two will be better . Instead of dividing the episode into two parts , they should have made a two hour episode . What's with the shadows or the girl ? I guess I will find out next week . I do not know why they introduced a meeting with the boys ' father . You have really no character develop because he is never in any of the episodes . They should have an episode where they introduce the father and show what he was like before he went away . The audience has no reference with the father , but more with Dean and Sam . Can't wait for next week's episode . 7 out 10 .
364348	4888011	94939	7.0	Abracadabra and hocus pocus !	Another cartoon compilation ? ! Yes , and this one's pretty clever . It features Daffy Duck opening a business to battle supernatural forces , a la " Ghostbusters " . Probably the funniest part was the cartoon where Bugs Bunny stays in Count Dracula's castle and upsets the count's ( after ) lifestyle , but it was also really something when the sick millionaire threw all the pies at Daffy , and when Daffy scared Porky . Still , I never quite understood the whole part about the money disappearing . So , " Daffy Duck's Quackbusters " isn't quite the same as the classic cartoons , but it's still worth seeing . Don't be surprised if , after watching this , you go around saying " abracadabra " and " hocus pocus " . If I may add something , the two segments with Sylvester were also neat .
548143	1111192	290002	8.0	As funny as " Meet the Parents " , but not as realistic .	Or to put it another way , I found it as funny , but not as believable as the first movie . Still it was a good comedy . . . once again Ben Stiller and Robert DeNiro are the stars of the show , but Dustin Hoffman and Streisand are very nice additions to the cast . It isn't without its flaws however , but neither was the first one . Though in this movie DeNiro's character seems to have reverted back to the way he was during " Meet the Parents " and in some aspects he seems even worse this time . The RV seems a bit much too , I don't think they just give those out in the CIA . However , those minor faults aside it is well worth a look . I love the way the movie started out with everything going perfect for Focker and his bride to be , but you know the exact moment when the tides begin to turn with a simple bloody nose .

Jinx the cat returns as do a lot of the original cast including a cameo from Owen Wilson near the end .
371773	2488512	36591	7.0	Delightful Naive Adventure	In Baghdad , in the days of the Mongol invasion leaded by the cruel Hugalu Khan ( Kurt Katch ) , the caliph Hassan ( Moroni Olsen ) is betrayed by Prince Cassim ( Frank Puglia ) and killed by the Mongols . His son Ali , who had just pledged love to Prince Cassim's daughter Amara , escapes and accidentally finds the magic cave Sesame , the hiding place of forty thieves leaded by Baba ( Fortunio Bonanova ) . Ali is adopted by Baba , who assigns the strong Abdullah ( Andy Devine ) to protect him . For ten years , the Mongols held Baghdad , and Ali Baba ( Jon Hall ) becomes the leader of the forty thieves , now beloved by the population for challenging the invaders . When the thieves acknowledge that a caravan is bringing Lady Amara ( Maria Montez ) to marry the tyrant Hugalu Khan , Ali Baba meets her bathing and does not recognize her . The Mongols capture him and he believes she betrayed him . Amara's servant Jamiel ( Turhan Bey ) helps Ali Baba , and the thieves rescue him in Baghdad and abduct Amara . In the garden of Prince Cassim's garden , they have recollections of their childhood , but they do not recognize each other . When Ali finds the truth , he fights for his love and for the freedom of Baghdad . " Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves " is a delightful naive adventure that brings me back to my childhood , when I loved to see the movie because of the magic cave that opened and closed with the commands : " - Open , Oh Sesame ! " , or " - Close , Oh Sesame ! " . The story is simple , with the evil Hugalu Khan in the always invaded Baghdad ; the traitor Prince Cassim ; the forty bandits that become good guys ; the hero Ali Baba and the heroine Amara , and lots of action for children and adults . Title ( Brazil ) : " Ali Baba e os Quarenta Ladrões " ( " Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves " )
494304	342623	39666	7.0	Warners potboiler gave the Oomph Girl even more oomph !	Ann Sheridan is a nightclub singer who gets involved with a straitlaced , married doctor in " Nora Prentiss " - and the consequences are interesting indeed . The doctor is played by Kent Smith , well-remembered by yours truly as the husband of Simone Simon in " Cat People . " Though he never reached big movie stardom , Smith enjoyed a 40 + year career in film , on radio , and TV . In this , he's regimented and by the book , partly helped by his equally disciplined wife , played by another favorite of mine , Rosemary DeCamp , a wonderful actress . One night , Prentiss ends up in his office with a mild injury , and from then on , the good doctor can't imagine life without her and what he's been missing . Conflicted about asking his wife for a divorce , one day , an opportunity drops into his office , and nothing is the same again . This is an intriguing film , but it takes a little bit too long to get to the point . The ending by ' 40s standards took me by surprise . Though Sheridan is nothing like Kay Francis , they both are women associated with a certain era - you can't think of Francis without thinking of her in those flowing ' 30s gowns and outfits - and you can't think of Sheridan without tailored suits and shoulder pads . They went along well with her earthy quality and low speaking voice . The overall effect was of someone who had been around the block but still had her dignity and self-respect . Photographed by James Wong Howe in this film , she looks marvelous . Though IMDb doesn't state if she did her own singing in " Nora Prentiss , " if she didn't , the voice matched her speaking voice perfectly and sounded great . Kent Smith is very good as the pent-up , frustrated doctor . One criticism would be that most of the times , doctors look at bodies clinically and aren't usually embarrassed by the site of a woman's knee , as Smith is in one of the opening scenes . However , he's very effective , as are Robert Alda and the always reliable Bruce Bennett in smaller roles . This film apparently did a lot for Sheridan's career , which is understandable . Very good movie .
398866	1391795	87597	7.0	Entertaining , family-friendly sci-fi .	Teenager Alex Rogan ( Lance Guest ) is despondent over the fact that he can't seem to escape from his mundane trailer park existence . Little does he know that the arcade game that he has mastered is actually a recruiting tool to find individuals who can help an alien civilization defend themselves from interstellar villains . " Cute " probably would be the most apt description of this 1980's product , a harmless , effects and design driven " Star Wars " variation with a most likable cast . Guest and his love interest Catherine Mary Stewart have a real earnestness and down-to-earth quality ( Guest also has an amusing scene where's he's acting opposite himself ) . Veteran actors Robert Preston , as " Centauri " , and Daniel O'Herlihy , as ' gung-ho iguana ' Grig , are a pleasure to watch , with O'Herlihy stealing all of his scenes . There's no real objectionable content , and not much in it that might prove to be too scary for the younger viewer . Overall , it is kind of lightweight and not terribly memorable , but it does have its charms .
367845	2707735	96487	8.0	" Get ready for hell ! "	I've always enjoyed watching this movie , and with my most recent viewing I followed up with the episode of ' Billy The Kid ' from the three disc ' Gunfighters ' DVD collection from Nonfiction Films ( 1998 , listed as ' Gunfighters of the West ' in the IMDb database ) . It was pretty surprising to see how closely the film followed real events in the life of The Kid , born Henry McCarty in New York City's Lower East Side in 1859 . All the business with John Tunstall ( Terence Stamp ) and Alex McSween ( Terry O'Quinn ) is based in fact , although the real name of the Jack Palance character was Jimmy Dolan . He was a real life businessman ( read that town boss of Lincoln County ) who was challenged by Tunstall for rights to government contracts at Fort Stanton in the New Mexico Territory . Dolan headquartered his ' Company ' at an establishment named the House of Murphy , hence the name Lawrence G . Murphy used in the picture . The ensuing Lincoln County Wars , often depicted as a range war , was in fact a mercantile war fought essentially over the right of one faction to make more money than the other . I've often wondered whether the real life Billy would have been as maniacal as the way he was portrayed by Emilio Estevez . I would almost think so , but with the kind of charisma that made him entirely likable as a person to those who knew him well and called him friend . Estevez , along with his brat pack buddies have an engaging chemistry on screen , even if most of it is spent dispatching members of Murphy's thugs . If not for Estevez's pacing of the character , the tone of the film would have been entirely different , as most of the men gunned down in the course of the story were simply murdered to avenge the death of Tunstall . My favorite scene had to do with the gunslinger in the saloon who Billy mocked into a gun-down . I'd consider that one of the fictional elements thrown into the story to highlight just how duplicitous the real life Kid could be . Did you notice how the gang reacted instinctively to back up their leader just in case ? I'm not as familiar with the sequel to " Young Guns " as the original . Both were written by John Fusco , so I'd expect that the continuity relative to historical accuracy is similarly maintained . Over forty films have been made about the legend of Billy the Kid , along with the blatantly contrived two season TV Western " The Tall Man " from the early 1960's . Your best bet apart from the documentary mentioned earlier , while maintaining an element of entertainment , would be tuning into " Young Guns " .
403173	453228	416449	6.0	Just OK	I was taught by my history professor to never praise Sparta , but the Athenians instead . Sparta's militaristic , autocratic and closed society hurt growth more than it helped . I kept this in mind . I found the military strategy , planing and organization of the film excellent . CGI was way too much making the film like a comic book . Persia grew from the growth of other societies and won by scale according to the movie . I did not understand the king's denial when the deal was offered for Sparta to keep its own land and expand in exchange for use of services like their army . I guess there is a need for politicians . Gladiator , Troy , and Alexiader were better movies in different ways . There was a need to show more of the drudgery of Spartan life in the movie . Not a bad movie !
527376	4445210	59598	10.0	The Most Incredible And Funny Fly I've Ever Seen , And The Best Sound	The beginning of this Pink Panther cartoon certainly was different . Inserted in the animation were real-life , black-and-white pictures of various action scenes on an animated television set . We see a sleepy-eyed Panther with his remote control changing channels . ( I don't even remember having remote-controls back in the mid ' 60s ! ) . On the floor is a bunch of junk food ( with potato chips misspelled as " potatoe . " ) Anyway , the idea is the Panther is exhausted and wants some sleep . He goes to bed , begins to sleep but his loud snoring wakes himself up . Then , the big gag of the cartoon , after going back asleep again , a buzzing fly wakes him up and torments him . This fly is awesome ! After being booted out of house , he knocks on the door and gets back in ! Later , he finds another clever way to get back inside and dive bomb our trying-to-sleep hero . Still , later he finds an even-more totally outrageous way to get back in the house . Each time it gets funnier . For the first time ever , I appreciated the sound in here more than anything . The fly , the Panthers laughs , the fly's laugh , the noises made by fly as he did various things . . . . . all of them are extremely funny . This is a terrific PP cartoon ; one of the best .
399942	1391795	57128	8.0	A slick , stylish and spooky Corman - Poe - Lovecraft - Price - Chaney combo .	Evil warlock Joseph Curwen ( Vincent Price ) is burned alive by an angry mob as this film opens . Over a hundred years later , his descendant , Charles Dexter Ward ( Price again ) is coming to the town of Arkham to claim the castle that Curwen once lived in . The new crop of villagers are suspicious of the newcomer , believing that he will be just like his ancestor . Roger Corman wanted a little break from his Edgar Allan Poe cycle , deciding that he wanted - just for once - to do an H . P . Lovecraft adaptation , believing that the style of the two writers was similar enough . " The Haunted Palace " is more or less based on the Lovecraft short story " The Case of Charles Dexter Ward " , and is bookended by Price recitals of the Poe poem . The result is neither Lovecraft nor Poe but a neat amalgam of ideas . Filmed in the excellent Panavision aspect ratio of the other Poe adaptations , Corman and his regular crew crafted a typically good looking horror movie . In contrast to his direct Poe adaptations , Corman had cameraman Floyd Crosby shoot darker than usual , which he felt better suited the style of Lovecraft . There are some really tense moments , and some shocking ones , to boot . Ted Coodley and Verne Langdon contribute some interesting and innovative makeup effects . A particular standout is the ominous music score by Ronald Stein ( some folks consider it his best ) - booming at times and really subtle at others . Vincent Price delivers yet another captivating ( dual ) performance , as he subtly delineates two different characters . The film has a truly superior supporting cast , as well , as Price gets to share scenes with another well-loved horror icon , Lon Chaney ( Jr . ) . Debra Paget is a lovely and bewitching female lead , and I thought that Frank Maxwell , Leo Gordon , and John Dierkes were all terrific . Especially welcome is old Hollywood favorite Elisha Cook ( Jr . ) . This is a grandly entertaining film , which should prove to be interesting if you pair it alongside 1992s ' " The Resurrected " ( directed by Dan O'Bannon ) , which is a more faithful adaptation of the Lovecraft story . I strongly recommend it .
532614	70535	87022	5.0	Average who-dunnit	The police investigate the murder of a couple of models who work for the same agency . The killer is bumping off the girls according to the name of the month they go by , so the cops stake out the next girl in line . There are some good suspects , but no one they can pin the deaths on until they get just the break they need . Nothing special in this one ; sort of a low budget film .
509063	453068	83946	10.0	the most operatic documentary-style epic ever made - fearlessly unique	The story of Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald , aka Fitzcarraldo , is as much the story of his magnanimous pie in the sky ideal to push a boat over a mountain as it is Werner Herzog's own mission to film it . More than a mission - as anyone who saw Burden of Dreams can report - an obsession that might cost a few lives , a good deal of money , and bring a lot of strange first-hand looks at the lives and mind-sets of the natives , but will still bring the greatest of wonders if it gets pulled off . The boat over the mountain is part metaphor , anyway , though not one that's easily pegged into a corner . Achieving something against the odds is something that has been covered in many great films , a quest through man's indelible need to make the impossible possible , be it in a David Lean picture ala Lawrence of Arabia , or in one of Cecil B . DeMille's pictures ( and , at times , I wondered if the spirit of one of those old time epic filmmakers came into his mind , if only in bits ) . All the while as Herzog is out to map the course of this man who just wants the purity of opera in the jungle , but through a style that is completely all his own , which means that it's not just about one man , but also about the ones around him , the methods to following such delusions of grandeur . Like Aguirre , there's a God complex working in Fitzcarraldo , only this time it's not in the total shroud of madness . There's room for irony , spouts of wild humor ( sometimes from Kinski , like when he tries to play an opera record for disinterested party-goers early on in the film ) , and an overwhelming fascination with what's all around Fitzcarraldo , the jungle , nature , the natives that dwell there and always stick to their indeterminable ways . Watching how Herzog maneuvers through his bulky story is ceaselessly compelling , even in the moments where he just lets the camera take everything in : the waves crashing all around , the boat set against the jungle-scape with the opera singer Caruso in the background , the many faces and poses of the natives and their moments of pure calm versus their unpredictable nature ( why do they put on face paint like they're about to go to war , and then nothing happens , don't ask me ) . And like in many of his best films , Herzog manages to get much more out of his actors / non-actors and his locations than it might have seemed on paper . Poetry gets set into motion with seemingly the greatest of ease , like a scene where a few natives on a small canoe look on , and Fitzcarraldo thinks about stopping , but they just go on as it's not even worth it , or when he and his first-mate and couple other regulars on the ship try to eat , only surrounded by the natives . Or the shocking moments when after victory seems to be achieved , all is in peril as the boat flaps about on the river and the recording still goes on and on , haunting as anything the jungle can compare to . Indeed , the jungle itself becomes another key part of Herzog's metaphor , even more so than in Aguirre , and it's perfectly exploited ( or rendered , depending on point of view ) for Herzog's own feelings about the jungle . It's an environment dangerous , alluring , and with the capacity to fear its awesome mass as well as beauty ( or , as Herzog said in ' Burden ' , it's lovable against better judgment ) , so it's not all taken in at a distance - there isn't so much a real sense of escapism via the hand-held shots unlike in the epics of the directors previously mentioned . Fitcarraldo's own quest then is against nature's own ways - nature is objective and always the same - as the simple notion of moving the boat , and then doing it , goes against nature's true nature , if that makes sense . In this sense it's a great film of the objective , to which Herzog goes to lengths to capture , and the fantastical and subjective , which comes through the operatic portions , and not be bound by nature's usual ways and common sense . Thus it makes perfect sense as well to have Kinski along for the ride , even if it's not his greatest achievement with his most frequent director . It's all in the eyes , practically every step of the way , that one believes this man even through all of the follies and naive flights of fancy , and it's the closest Kinski probably ever came to playing the romantic lead of an adventure picture . Some of the usual scenes of ' damn he's nuts ' come up , like his ringing of the town bell . It's another in the line of outcasts he played in Herzog's films , tormented and always in craving for something more , though this time not in a bleak manner . There is the problem that Kinski's presence would be undermined by the many " adequate " images Herzog loves to achieve . Luckily , he stands his ground , and even contributes to the poetry in times of just listening to the Caruso , and gazing on at his dream coming true on the mountainside . Fitzcarraldo isn't perfect by any means , as it ends up by way of the nature of Herzog's storytelling to almost tell of too much in his scenes . And the English language track I heard sometimes dilutes a few of the performances by feeling too dubbed and a little ridiculous in some instances . But these are just tiny mentions that get overlooked when looking at the success of what is done . Only a director as intelligently deranged and confident as Herzog could have dreamed up this film ( based on a true character ) and make it as real and alive as the greatest of epic adventures .

384939	391152	84654	8.0	Quite good	A man runs into a pretty but aging woman in the middle of a rainstorm . He politely protects her from the downpour with his umbrella , and even lifts her over a fence so she can get to her bus . He also gets on the bus , and , beginning to pant , she declares that she can't go near anyone else on the bus , because she's a famous actress and she'll be thronged . The other passengers on the bus look up at the exasperated woman , but don't pay her any more mind than that . A bit later , the woman proudly tells the man that she is Veronika Voss , and all he can do is politely nod . She hasn't been in a movie for three years , and hasn't been in a good one for longer than that . Veronika has to try really hard to pin the man , Robert , down and seduce him , and even when she accomplishes this feat he doesn't seem particularly interested . Robert's interest does grow when he begins to discover some nasty secrets about her life , notably that she is addicted to morphine . A strange doctor seems to be little more than a local drug dealer when he begins to look into the situation . The plot is decent ; it would have been a really good one for a classic Hollywood film starring Joan Crawford or Bette Davis or someone like that . Its greatest worth is in the performance of Rosel Zech , who has the titular role . Cornelia Froboess as Robert's girlfriend and Annemarie Düringer as the wicked doctor are also good . The character of Robert is never very interesting . The black and white cinematography ( Xaver Schwarzenberger ) and the unconventional score ( Peer Raben ) are very good . The tape I watched was not in a very good condition , so I may have liked it more if I had seen a better copy . .
384973	391152	94663	8.0	One of Woody's most mature and underrated dramas	There was a certain period in Woody Allen's career when he was trying desperately to imitate Ingmar Bergman's work . It rarely worked , and often turned out disasters like the execrable September . Another Woman is a riff on Bergman's Wild Strawberries : a college professor , played by Gena Rowlands , is past fifty and looking back on and reliving key events in her life as her present life is falling apart . The film is quite stagy at times , just as it was in September , Allen's previous film . He seems to think that adds something , but it really doesn't . One other problem Another Woman has is a couple of very clunky scenes , and a few poor bit performers , which were much bigger problems in September , which was actually the last Allen film that I saw and the one that made me subconsciously avoid him for the past several months . Allen's script here is excellent . He has produced an excellent character study which is probably unsurpassed in all of his other films that I've seen . The lead actors are wonderful here , Rowlands , Ian Holms , Blythe Danner , Sandy Dennis , and Gene Hackman . Allen's use of piano music is beautifully touching . It all adds up to a very touching and sad little film . It might not be Woody's best film , but it ought to be better respected and known . .

The film , marketed for a teen audience , is an impressionistic retelling of Marie Antoinette's life as a young queen in the opulent and eccentric court at Versailles . The film focuses on Marie Antoinette , as she matures from a teenage bride to a young woman and eventual queen of France . . . and if the film was to be a cake , it would indeed be a Dundee cake . Rich , fruity and very nutty . it is impossible not to like Coppolas movie , even when realising how absurd the whole thing is when watching it . it does take an hour to get going but once it does get going , it is like a psychedelic trip through candy-land , full of wonderful characters and amazing scenery . the problem is the script , it's trying to be too hip , almost teaching a history lesson to the MTV generation , and becomes it's own worse enemy . the cast are fine in their respective roles , but Schwartzman does feel a little out of place and doesn't really convince as the young easily influenced King . Dunst is wonderful as the titular character , having an air of teenage angst about her , and adds the ' fruit ' to the recipe . but the icing on the proverbial ' cake ' is the mesmerising soundtrack . attention to detail has been made for the music and it really makes the movie the leftfield piece it is . a very odd movie , arguably bad , but impossible not to enjoy .
574280	4532636	55852	9.0	Spending Time with Cleo	The Cleo in " Cleo from 5 to 7 " is a frivolous , spoiled singer living in Paris . The 5 to 7 refers to the two hours ( roughly ) of the day we spend with her as she awaits the results of a medical test that will tell her whether or not she has cancer . During that time , we watch her pout , sulk , buy a hat , and goof around with friends , but it's not until the film's final moments , when Cleo meets a total stranger , that she has anything resembling meaningful interaction with another human being . The most remarkable thing about " Cleo from 5 to 7 " is the performance of Corinne Marchand in the title role . Her Cleo is petulant and unlikable in the film's early moments , and she barely plays a part in her own story . She's not even so much afraid of dying as she is of losing her beauty . But over the course of the film , we see her gradually emerge from her pampered shell and flower into a three dimensional woman , capable of complicated thought and emotion . It's a minor miracle of acting . The film doesn't exactly have a happy ending , but it's not really a downer either . Cleo gets her diagnosis , but her reaction to it surprises us . Her final words in the film are about her feeling happy - - the way she delivers the line leads us to believe that this is a new sensation for her - - and at that point it's as if the diagnosis doesn't really matter anymore , either for her or us .
572150	4248714	78504	2.0	The Wiz	Forget what you've seen with Judy Garland and The Muppets , this nothing like either of them , in pretty much all aspects , from director Sidney Lumet and writer Joel Schumacher . It has the same basic story of The Wizard of Oz , but it is all black film with new songs ( no " Somewhere Over The Rainbow " here ) and new attitude . You know the story , Dorothy ( Diana Ross ) gets taken by a twister to the land of Oz , wants to go home , meets the Scarecrow ( Michael Jackson ) , Tinman ( Nipsey Russell ) and the Lion , aka Fleetwood Coupe De Ville ( Ted Ross ) , defeats the witch , meets the real " Wiz " , aka Herman Smith ( Richard Pryor ) and goes home clicking her silver shoes ( not ruby slippers ) three times . Also starring Mabel King as Evillene , Theresa Merritt as Aunt Emma , Thelma Carpenter as Miss One , Lena Horne as Glinda the Good and Stanley Greene as Uncle Henry . There is no Technicolor wonderland , what looks more like a Bronx alleyway , the only good song is the replacement of " Follow The Yellow Brick Road " , " Ease On Down The Road " , Jackson isn't too bad , he's just as energetic as Ray Bolger was , this just didn't strike me in any way . It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration , Best Cinematography , Best Costume Design and Best Music for Quincy Jones . Pretty poor !
490850	33913	91763	8.0	Not Stone's Best Film to Date !	I don't think this is Stone's best film to date . In fact , I loved JFK and consider it to be a masterpiece . Platoon is a war film and I'm not crazy about war films in general but Stone's direction and personal experience with Vietnam is clearly an effective tool in this film's brilliance . It's raw , ugly , dirty , and filthy but then what war isn't any of those things ? As far as Vietnam films , I preferred the Deer Hunter but I am going to say that Platoon goes further where other films have not gone before . It's different when the director has been there and done it himself as a Vietnam veteran like Roman Polanski who survived World War II POland as a child . There is nothing that they are not afraid to show as if they are holding something back . This film is about war and the young men who go only to return home differently . As far as I know , this film is still important today as it was twenty years ago . First rate cast include Charlie Sheen , Tom Berenger , and other young men .

He knows one of them is a werewolf - - but he's not sure which one . When they all arrive he won't let them leave . The next three nights will all have a full moon . . . and he expects to figure out who the werewolf is then . Hardly an original idea - - anybody ever read Agatha Christie's " Ten Little Indians " ? Also why exactly does Newcliffe want to kill a werewolf ? It's never made clear . This movies has tons of things wrong with it - - there's a long unnecessary car chase at the beginning ; Lockhart overacts to an embarrassing degree ; there's plenty of painfully obvious day for night shooting ; with a few exceptions all the characters are obnoxious ; dinner sequences go on forever ; Peter Cushing has a laughable accent and the " werewolf " itself is just a big dog with extra fur stuck on ! Also it's just painfully dull . Violence and gore is virtually nonexistent ( for the PG rating ) and there's not even a transformation scene ! What saves this from being totally unwatchable is some good acting by Cushing , Charles Gray and Marlene Clark and a " Werewolf Break " towards the end of the film . The audience is given 30 seconds to figure out who the werewolf is ! Still that's not enough to make you sit through this . A 5 all the way .

She meets up with Dempsey and goes back home to get her divorce papers signed by Lucas so that she can marry the mayor's son .

This is one of Reese Witherspoon's best .

This provides the background for The Kid , seen in the second two movies , and he's genuinely not irritating in this ( no , seriously ) . The concept is highly interesting , although , for obvious reasons , this should not be seen by anyone too likely to imitate it , anyone whose behavior is that easily influenced . The animation is well-done and quite interesting , with a style of limited motion in the drawings , and the camera being responsible for a lot of the movement , in a way that feels reminiscent of regular , live-action films . The atmosphere is impeccable , and the pace is spot-on throughout . The voice acting is great , Watson does well with what few lines he has , as do Anne-Moss and Reeves . The idea and execution of this are excellent , and this is a remarkable addition to the overall universe . This has a making of , shared with Detective Story , which is well-done and informative . It's 9 and a half minutes , same as the short itself . This has one disturbing aspect , nothing objectionable beyond that . I recommend this to any fan of The Matrix franchise and / or science fiction in general .

515043	317399	1127884	5.0	A Nutshell Review : Hannah Montana / Miley Cyrus : Best of Both Worlds Concert Tour 3	Alright , I have to confess that I have no clue as to who Hannah Montana is , except that she is some " it " girl with some links to Disney , and was spoofed in Superhero Movie . She's a character played by Miley Cyus , daughter of Billy Ray Cyrus , who has to don a long and silky blonde wig to play her alter ego , and perhaps the only time I've seen Miley perform , was lending her non singing voice in Bolt . So I was precisely the proverbial fish out of water who knew zilch about the influence of Miley's reach , and know nothing too about the songs in both Montana and Cyrus ' discography . But of course that didn't persuade me otherwise not to go for this concert movie to find out a lot more in under 90 minutes , and being a 3D movie provided extra reason to do so as well . Being what would be my first 3D concert movie , the depth of field here worked wonders in tricking your senses that you were there at the performance , and every hand that shot up to wave about , or a pop of a head because of enthusiastic fans jumping up and down , would have you either want to reach out and slap them , or like the kids in the audience , they too were lured to mimic such typical enjoyment as if they were there , swaying , dancing , running around , doing cartwheels even ( ! ) just in front of the screen . These kids provided an additional D with their honest , devil-may-care participation . One too would expect just performance of a number after performance , and the only truly 3D-ish moments was the drummer who executed tossing his drumstick into the air , and with Miley herself throwing one right toward the camera , which made you cringe . Other than that , there's nothing unusual , and the documentary aspect of preparing for her concert turned out to be rather plain as well , beginning with designing the stage and the moves on a mock location , before wrapping everything after a full dress rehearsal for the actual performing location . Expect a number of talking heads from parents to co-performers peppering this concert movie , though there's absolutely nothing scandalous being said , more like plenty of pats on the back . Of the " two " performers here , personally I preferred Miley Cyrus ' turn rather than Hannah Montana , which I felt was a little bit fake to begin with , and of the songs performed , I had preferred Cyrus ' selection over Montana's . Then again , what would I know , since they're essentially the same person , and the age group this is targeted at , would have more discerning opinions . I'm just there to soak up the atmosphere , really . Give us U23D !
450066	2093818	120201	8.0	Another great film by Paul Verhoeven	Paul Verhoeven has a knack for making entertaining films that involve sex , violence and action ( not always the first , but the two last mentioned he always manages to deliver ) . Those three things , of course , do not make a great movie . He just somehow always finds a way to incorporate them into his movies , which are usually great . This is a science fiction action film , with social commentary and obvious stabs at America in general ( but mainly the politics and their seeming obsession with solving any conflict by violent means ) . You'll see the typical narrow-minded ( American ) individuals who dehumanize ( yes , I realize that they are aliens , but still ) the enemy in every possibly way , you'll see propaganda , there's even a scene where a member of a debate refuses to even think the thought of the enemy actually being intelligent beings . As an action film , it reminded me a little of RoboCop , but nearly everything was on a much larger scale . There are several epic battle scenes in this movie , and they are very well-made . The action scenes are all intense , and capture war conditions pretty good . The special effects are also very well-made , and add to the intensity by giving us a chance to see some very gruesome deaths and alien / futuristic weaponry . The film also has several camera pans and angles mainly used to show human death and misery . I think that was a good way to show how pointless and grotesque war really is . The plot is very good , and moves along at a great pace ; I wasn't really bored at any point in the film , and I've seen it four or five times now . The acting is mostly just below standard , but sometimes it drops several notches and goes to being ludicrous , and actually making the viewer snicker or laugh at what would have been a serious scene , had it not been painfully overacted . The characters all seemed fairly well-written and credible , though a few of them were stereotypes . The film also does have its share of clichés , but none of them ruin the movie . I haven't read the book this film was based on , but I doubt that it could present the social commentary much better , or done a much better job of mocking the general ignorance usually involved with war and the likes . If it does , I might just have to find it and read it sometime . I recommend this to fans of Verhoeven's other films , especially fans of RoboCop . If you're into social commentary and / or sci-fi action , you'll probably like it , too .
539116	3717154	427392	7.0	i'm all about the romance . . .	A mysterious epidemic is sweeping the world , but it takes one Washington DC psychiatrist to discover that the disease is extraterrestrial in origin . When her son becomes infected , she and a colleague must work together to find a cure , before the entire world is lost . . . although this is a remake of a remake of a remake , it has been updated for our times , The Invasion could be classed in some peoples opinions as an allegory to chemical warfare , and the paranoia surrounding the world since the beginning of the new millennium . there are some hidden meanings in this film , but in the end it comes across as a hybrid of ' Shaun of the Dead ' ( especially in the first act with random people standing around looking bored ) and ' 28 days later ' . in fact this could even be sneaked in to the zombie genre , rather than science fiction , although these ' beings do not eat brains etc , they still have the emotionless factor of the said Zombie . but the weak link in this movie is Kidman who just doesn't suit the part , and is utterly unconvincing , and Craig is just James Bond with longer hair and a Medical degree . the editing too is a little too sharp and can make the narrative seem a little confusing at times . but it's not the travesty it has been made out to be , there are some tense moments in the film and at just over ninety minutes it doesn't outstay it's welcome .
405927	2020269	180093	5.0	Drugs are bad , mmmkay ?	Requiem for a Dream must be one of the most unnecessarily overhyped films of the last few decades . By no means it's a bad film but ? is it really worth all the praising it gets and the commotion it caused ? After all , Darren Aranofski's film based on the novel by Herbert Selby is only stating the obvious ? Drugs are bad and they will , eventually , lead you into a downward spiral of madness and destroy your life . When talking about the screenplay , Requiem for a Dream has nothing new or extraordinary to offer . We follow the unhealthy actions of 4 people . Jarred Leto and Marlon Wayans star as two Coney Island junkies who want to get rich fast and easy by dealing drugs . Leto's character Harry is doing it all for his beautiful girlfriend Marion ( Jennifer Connelly ) so she can open her very own fashion store , selling her proper designs . Ellen Burstyn puts down an amazing performance as Leto's TV-addicted mother who gets hooked on diet pills after she's made believe to appear on her favorite show . I repeat , Requiem for a Dream certainly isn't a bad film . It even is a very well elaborated story with fascinating acting . But the main problem , I think , is that Arranofski too easily thinks that he created a controversial shocker . And that's not the case ? It might look like he directed the perfect " Anti-Drug-Therapy " movie to him , but he's about 10 years too late for that . Fans of art-house cinema will merely look at it as ' been there , seen that ' . The visual experiments often annoy and the characters are a bit too shallow to feel any compassion for . The musical score , however , is simply brilliant and probably even the most powerful aspect about the entire film . Although I haven't been able to find it yet , I'm expecting a lot more from ' Last Exit to Brooklyn ' , which was also adapted from a Herbert Selby novel . Requiem for a Dream is recommended ? but please don't rate it here on this site . It's already ranked way too high in the IMDb top 250 .
367982	2707735	31589	6.0	" Oh I get it , we're going places . "	This is the first time I've seen a Lone Wolf movie , and I was struck by the similarity to the Bulldog Drummond series from the same era . Not only did the main characters have a canine nom de plume , but each featured a comic relief butler and a fetching female hanger on that can't wait to get married . In the Drummond franchise , the marriage just around the corner bit was carried from film to film , though I don't know how the Lone Wolf series handled it . I'll have to wait and see . The caper involving Lone Wolf Lanyard ( Warren William ) also hints at those encountered by Drummond , Charlie Chan , and Mr . Wong , to name a few other detectives of the era , even though Lanyard isn't a detective per se , but a retired safe cracker who appears to be on the right side of the law . I found it odd that he considered himself ' old ' at thirty five ; it gives one a sense of how far we've come as a society that puts a premium on perpetual youth . Can you picture George Clooney admitting that he's old ? The story involves a set of plans for a new anti-aircraft gun , with lead villain Gregory ( Ralph Morgan ) attempting to steal the prints and frame Lanyard for the theft . I couldn't shake the feeling that the whole thing was done pretty much tongue in cheek , as the Lone Wolf seemed to be the only competent character amidst a jealous girl friend ( Ida Lupino ) , bumbling henchmen , inept detectives , and an aspiring G-Man , er , Woman daughter ( Virginia Weidler ) who likes to stick up the butler in repeated scenes . You even get Rita Hayworth as a femme fatale , a pretty classy villainess I must say . It's too bad attempts at humor often fell flat , like the Charlie Fenton gimmick at the surrealist party . Speaking of which , you can see the folks behind this ' B ' grade mystery didn't have a big budget to work with , as party guests showed up with boxes or cellophane wrapped around their head , making Lanyard's tree branch outfit look almost creative . Hey , I did get a kick though out of that car chase around the coffee shop . By the third time around , someone figured out there should be a police car in front of it so the cops could give pursuit ! If you're a fan of the earlier mentioned mystery and detective flicks of the Thirties and Forties like I am , you'll be able to have some fun with this one . They're interesting diversions and offer a glimpse of what audiences considered entertaining at the time . Just don't hold them under a magnifying glass . $38 . 70 for lunch ! ! ! !
572649	4248714	112697	7.0	Clueless	Apparently a remake of Jane Austen's Emma for the modern world , from writer / director Amy Heckerling ( Fast Times at Ridgemont High ) . Basically Cher Horowitz ( Batman & Robin's Alicia Silverstone ) is the rich , pretty , blonde and popular girl who knows how to talk anyone into doing almost anything , and also the narrator . When Cher can't get a better grade from her teacher Mr . Wendell Hall ( Toy Story's Wallace Shawn ) , she and her friend Dionne ( Stacey Dash , who played the same character in the Clueless TV series ) match him up with Miss Toby Geist ( Twink Caplan ) to them happier , and maybe boost their expectations . Cher is happy doing " good deeds " , and when new girl Tai ( Brittany Murphy ) shows up , Cher and Dionne give her a makeover and try to get her a boyfriend . Cher realises doing this she wants a boyfriend as well , but she can't find the right guy . As she continues a spiritual makeover , she realises theirs more to life than clothes and popularity , and the guy of her dreams is the guy she has spent most time with as a friend , Josh ( Paul Rudd ) . She should have also realised Tai was infatuated with Travis ( Road Trip's Breckin Meyer ) , and vice versa , not the guy she expected to like her , Elton ( Jeremy Sisto ) , and also the guy she originally wanted as a boyfriend , Christian ( Justin Walker ) was gay , it was obvious . Also starring Donald Faison as Murray , Elisa Donovan as Amber and Dan Hedaya as Mel Horowitz . It is in my book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die , I'd have to see it more to agree with that , but it is a good film . Very good !
427416	3079504	70526	3.0	A kiss ? No none for me thanks	1970's horror movie that seems more silly then scary with an evil scientist and psychic countess lurking about in the dungeon of a castle making efforts to raise the dead . The ghoul they bring back looks rather silly and would have looked silly when the film was made . The look and sensibility of the film is decidedly European in flavor but it doesn't add up to much . Honestly I could have done with out the fashion show at the start since it both portents a large scale film then we get and it also distracts from getting the story underway . If you ask me this is a clunker . ( Thats just my opinion , There are several people I know who love this film , but I just don't understand what they see it it . )
548866	1111192	79945	2.0	You have heard from the trek fans now . . .	Here from some one who doesn't really care for the Trek sensation . This movie is a complete waste of two hours . . . it starts promisingly enough with a mysterious cloud heading toward earth . Klingons are attacking it , but it wipes them out . The rest of the flick is a big snooze . Prolonged scenes of people looking at ships , clouds , man it was quite non-entertaining . And the ending was lame as was the identity of vger . I will never understand the facsination some people have with sci-fi . . . I mean I like a good sci-fi flick , but star trek for me has always been kinda boring ( not pt 2 . which is the best star trek movie ) .
366365	3109237	366292	7.0	A restrained Miike	In Takashi Miike's One Missed Call , there's really very little new ground covered . If I've seen one Asian film that revolves around a pale-skinned , long black-haired female ghost , I feel as if I've seen a dozen . Whether One Missed Call is derivative of other Asian horror films or whether it's the other way around , I don't know ( or really care ) . The similarities , though , are undeniable . But it hardly matters when it comes to enjoying the movie . Miike has put together an entertaining and at times frightening tale of a young girl seeking retribution for her death . It's far less bloody and over-the-top than most of Miike's other films , but for the most part , it works . Miike is much more restrained and relies on very subtle moments to create unease in the viewer . One of the best examples is the " ghost in the cupboard " scene . It's a simple moment without a lot of fanfare , but it's very effective in generating the desired response . Other highlights of the film include the death scene at the television studio and the search through the abandoned hospital . These moments help Miike's film standout from the crowded field of similarly themed J-horror films . Whether the plots of these J-horror ghost stories appeal to you or not , as usual , it's difficult to deny the level of artistry and technical brilliance that goes into these films . One Missed Call is no exception . Thanks to some interesting cinematography and lighting , the film has a " look " that helps create an atmosphere of dread . The special effects , both visual and sound , are well done . The acting is good . Both of the leads , Kou Shibasaki and Shin'ichi Tsutsumi , are more than adequate . And Miike's direction expertly creates the desired tension . Overall , it's the kind of well-made Asian horror film that I've come to expect . But One Missed Call isn't without its faults . Beyond the " been there , done that " aspects of the plot , the film's pacing could have been better . While the first and third acts are enjoyable , the middle portion of the One Missed Call tends to drag a bit . Some of the investigation scenes into what's behind the mystery put a halt to what is an otherwise well paced film . A little judicious editing might have helped the film flow better . One Missed Call also includes a number of plot points that are never adequately resolved . For example , why was the mother's dead body in the abandoned hospital ? And could the ending have been more confusing ? I admit that I'm completely at a loss to explain the films finale . That doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it , but don't ask me what it all meant . Maybe a second viewing is necessary to resolve some of these issues .
401273	7743887	96624	9.0	We Could Laugh Then , We Can Only Cry Now	With its wall-to-wall soaps , crass quiz shows , tacky news coverage and brainless reality series , the launching of Rupert Murdoch's ' Sky T . V . ' in 1988 led some commentators to gloomily predict the beginning of the end for British television . ' K . Y . T . V . ' was a retaliatory strike against this new threat ; by ridiculing Sky's output it hoped to stave off the tidal wave of ' dumbed down ' dross . The first edition featured the striptease game ' Gettem Off ! ' and a pop show hosted by Ernie Wise and Eddie ' The Eagle ' Edwards . A World War Two tribute had presenters who clearly had no idea what they were talking about , and reconstructions of famous wartime events done with shop window dummies . The series grew out of the Radio 4 comedy ' Radio Active ' with the same cast reprising their roles . Funny though it was it failed to have the intended impact . Terrestrial television eventually decided ' if you can't beat ' em , join ' em ' . ' K . Y . T . V ' . was British television's last scream of despair . Before the lunatics took over the asylum . . .
499220	1355507	90233	3.0	Pretty bad film featuring a good cast .	Underworld starts as English high class hooker Nicole ( Nicola Cowper ) is kidnapped from her brothel . Rich businessman Hugo Motherskille ( Steven Berkoff ) hires her ex love Roy Bain ( Larry Lamb ) to find her , he heads straight for the brothel where he finds out she was addicted to a new drug called ' WhiteMare ' developed by posh Doctor Savary ( Denholm Elliott ) as a cure for heroin addiction . Unfortunately while it cured the test subjects of their addiction to heroin they became addicted to WhiteMare itself & it also has unwanted body deforming consequences & side effects . Not good really . However Nicole seems immune to the drugs side effects & a group of deformed users want to know why , it's up to Roy to sort this mess out & rescue Nicole . . . Known as Transmutations in the US this English production was directed by George Pavlou & quite frankly is crap . The script by James Caplin & Clive Barker based on one of his stories never really gets going , it never involves you , you never care about anything , it's slow , it's dull , it's utterly predictable with a pointless twist you can see coming a mile off & it's just not much fun to watch either . Being based on a story by Barker you would expect plenty of monsters & gore but Underworld features a few tardily made up creatures who get about 10 minutes worth of screen time & absolutely no gore whatsoever . I'm sure the artwork on any DVD / video release plays up the mutants involvement in the film but seriously they don't feature properly until past the hour mark & even then their presence is underwhelming . Most of Barker's work deals with religion & mystical reasoning behind his monstrous creations but here it all revolves around a drug , yawn . Then there's the fact that London seems deserted , the character's & dialogue are poor & for some reason everyone has bizarre names like Pepperdine , Motherskille , Fluke & Nygaard . We never learn why Nicole is immune to the drugs side effects either even though it's an important plot point , it's a film where you just don't care about anything that's happening on screen . Director Pavlou also directed the Barker penned adaptation of Rawhead Rex ( 1986 ) a year later , why did Barker choose him again ? Underworld is a totally flat , dull & lifeless 100 odd minutes . He seems to think as long as he bathes every shot in pink , purple , orange & blue neon that's enough to turn in a stylish flick , well he's wrong as it gets very samey very quickly & since the on screen action is so dull the awkward lighting stands out like a sore thumb . Disappointingly the film lacks imagination as well , the underworld mutants are just actors with lumps on their faces & apart from one brief scene at the end when someone pulls some skin of their cheek there isn't a single drop of blood in the entire thing . It's definitely not scary , it's certainly has no tension & has precisely zero atmosphere . Technically the film is pretty good actually , it's well made I suppose & looks very professional . How on Earth did they get such a good cast to agree to appear in this ? Denholm Elliott , Steven Berkoff , Art Malik , Ingrid Pitt & Miranda Richardson all deserve better than this . Underworld is a poor Clive Barker penned film , I'd imagine most of the blame has to go to first time director Pavlou who probably ruined Barker's scripts ( Barker himself admitted he directed Hellraiser ( 1987 ) himself because of his dissatisfaction with the results of both Underworld & Rawhead Rex ) . A disappointing waste of time , steer clear which won't be a problem as it's pretty obscure & hopefully it'll stay that way . Not to be confused with the Kate Beckinsale big budget horror action flicks Underworld ( 2003 ) & it's sequel Underworld : Evolution ( 2006 ) .
454906	11228318	38057	8.0	Fritz Lang's Scarlet Street gets a fine performance from Robinson	Scarlet Street was one of the most interesting film noirs for me because of Edward G . Robinson's characterization of a meek man forced into crime instead of his usual tough guys . I loved an early scene he had with co-worker Samuel S . Hinds about inviting him to his house . That set the tone of what a nice man Robinson is here . Then he saves Joan Bennett from an attacker and they have a dinner where he lets her believe he's a wealthy painter instead of a clerk who just celebrated his 25th anniversary at his company with a gift watch . What he doesn't know was that her " attacker " was her boyfriend Dan Duryea who likes to slap her once in awhile . While you can see some twists come a mile away , the performances of the three leads and many of the supporting ones are so compelling that you're with them and director Fritz Lang every step of the way . Writer Dudley Nichols ' dialogue is so snappy with irony that while the whole thing is treated seriously you can't help but laugh at some scenes . I especially liked Durea's " For cat's sake , he's lying " at the end of his cross-examination after hearing Robinson's claiming he " copied " Katherine's ( Bennett ) paintings ! Good performances from the actresses playing Katherine's roommate and Robinson's wife Adele . Well worth seeking for film noir fans .
436947	9938570	384642	5.0	Kicking and Screaming	Okay Will Ferrell vehicle has the comedian portraying Phil Weston , a vitamins salesman whose whole life has been reduced to low expectations , trying to compete with a father who seems to have succeeded at everything while he has always failed . The only way it seems he'll ever feel good about himself is if he beats Daddy Weston ( Robert Duvall , coasting on his charisma ) where he's best at . . the soccer field . Daddy Weston is THE soccer coach in their little league ( THE GLADIATORS ) and Ferrell's Phil desperately wants to beat his father in the finals to properly say he's the best . We see how Phil is a failure in getting a team going until he partners up with his father's arch-nemesis . . Mike Ditka ! If you are a fan of Ferrell comedies , this will be sure to please . But , this genre has been milked to death and then some and the final result leaves no one surprised . It is funny seeing what Phil becomes as he starts to see success , telling his kids to snap clavicles and smash collar-bones as if this were jail-football . But , the film has the " like father like son " angle as Phil leaves his son on the the bench the very same way Daddy Weston did him .
427612	3079504	1065060	5.0	After a good start the film waders off and never really amounts to much , but its worth seeing late at night curled up on the couch	After a gallery robbery the crooks wait in a warehouse for the man who hired them to show up and pay them . The location was once used to make films of an unsettling nature . As the night wears on the ghosts of the past , a rat in the ranks and a hostage they grabbed all conspire to to dwindle the numbers of thieves . Okay caper horror film starts off good and then begins to wobble as logic comes and goes beginning with why do they kidnap the woman who's car they carjack ? ( Other than to get a woman into the mix . ) Taken on its own terms its an okay little movie , unremarkable and somewhat forgettable , but haunted by the feeling that the film should have been better . As it stands now its something I'd wait to stumble over on cable .
453211	15896852	17534	6.0	Haines Makes You Feel Good	William Haines ( as Brice Wayne ) is a cocky West Point cadet , and star football player , who alienates his teammates with his arrogance , and lack of team spirit . His steadfast pal , William Bakewell ( as Tex McNeil ) , can't defend Mr . Haines without ending up in the hospital ; and girlfriend Joan Crawford ( as Betty Channing ) grows more distant as Haines juvenile behavior becomes more and more tiresome . What will it take for Mr . Haines to win Ms . Crawford's heart ? Will Mr . Bakewell regain his health ? Can Haines straighten up in time to help his teammates win the big game ? " West Point " is a typical Haines film vehicle ; it is worth checking out to see the popular actor's performance , and enjoyable screen presence . It is neither his most satisfying characterization , nor his best film ; but , Haines is still great . Crawford's emoting is less polished , in an early role . Surprisingly , Bakewell offers the film's strongest performance ( highlighted by his hospital bed scene ) . Edward Sedgwick's direction makes the most of Haines ' silliness , and David Davidson's soundtrack is wonderful ( albeit sounding too seasonal , at times ) .
399934	1391795	36104	8.0	I really enjoyed this one .	Jerry Manning ( Dennis O'Keefe ) is the manager for a nightclub performer named Kiki Walker ( Jean Brooks ) and he gets the bright idea to have her bring in a leopard one night . The leopard gets spooked and runs off , only to maul a poor girl later that night . When more young victims are claimed , Jerry begins to doubt that it's still the work of the leopard . The New Mexico setting is a very good one for this well done Val Lewton production . It provides this incredibly spooky tale with real flavor in addition to the brooding atmosphere common to the Lewton canon . Director Jacques Tourner here had his third and final teaming with Lewton ( after " The Cat People " and " I Walked with a Zombie " ) and he really ratchets up the tension in some scenes . The sequence in which initial victim Teresa ( Margaret Landry ) is obliged to walk through a tunnel under a train overpass is completely unnerving . Lewton and Tourneur do a great job of setting up the scares with use of sound and firing our imagination as to how gruesome these murders are . Ardel Wray wrote the screenplay ( with an additional dialog credit for Edward Dein ) based on the Cornel Woolrich story " Black Alibi " . While it works very well as horror , as a mystery it's not so successful , with the perpetrator's identity a little too easy to guess . And the denouement isn't as satisfactory as the balance of the picture , although the motivation for the spree comes off as too creepily real , with what we now know about serial killers . And in the end , there's a bit of meditation on how people sometimes try to hide their feelings and fears behind a show of coolness and imperturbability . This is well worth catching for any fan of the classic style horror movies . It's a real gem with an always palpable mood and feel .

Archer authorizes the procedure but he has troubles with the fast-growing clone that has Trip memories and his own personality together .

438627	1617546	227627	6.0	Oops !	At first this appears to be simply another of the rather boring actualities of the last decade of the 19th Century , one of those very short films in which the real interest is seeing something that happened far away in a theater , the mere illusion of immediacy , perhaps , enough for a 19th century rube , but surely a sophisticated inhabitant of the 21st Century would not be affected by these images . Think again ! This shot of horse trooper on practice - - in this case , moving through an obstacle course a good deal like a steeplechase - - seems to be just a series of flowing images , everything perfect . Until someone misses his jump , falls - - - and you know he can be killed . A couple of weeks ago I saw this year's MAX PAYNE and yawned through the gun battles , as dozens of highly-trained snipers with machine guns were taken out by a guy with a pistol . This is far more believable - - and not , I fear , just because it is real . Have we become so caught up in the web of our cultural and storytelling assumptions that we cannot tell reality from illusion ? Who , then is the bumpkin and who the sophisticate ?
438455	1617546	151935	8.0	The Pen is Mightier Than The Sword	One of the best of Van Beuren's " Tom & Jerry " series in which they pull out a pencil and proceed to draw figures in the air which join the action : an early prefigurement , if you like , of Chuck Jones ' classic DUCK AMUCK . Van Beuren was one of the cartoon factories that flourished from about 1925-1936 . It released through RKO and went under shortly after RKO dropped its contract in favor of one with Disney . Although never the best of studios , its staff worked hard . Probably its best black and white series was " Tom & Jerry " a Mutt and Jeff combo that , like Fleischer's Betty Boop , started as cartoon dogs and evolved into a music-backed series . Disguised in rerelease from Official Films as ' Dick and Larry ' to avoid confusion with MGM's cat-and-mouse duo , a lot of their shorts have survived . A lot of their jokes are out of favor , but some are very amusing and if you wish to give them a try , this and PIANO TOONERS are good places to start .
497772	1355507	342835	4.0	Annoying killer / thriller / horror film .	Nightstalker starts in ' Los Angeles 1985 ' where one fateful night a man ( Bret Roberts ) has a bad foot fetish experience with a prostitute named Cherry ( Roxanne Day ) so he decides to don some black leather gloves & kill a couple of Hispanic people in they're own home . The next morning & Hispanic cops Officer's Gabriella Martinez ( Roselyn Sanchez ) & Frank Luis ( Danny Trejo ) are called to the house when relatives become worried , the two Officer's enter the house & find the mutilated & violated corpses . The killer seems to target the Hispanic community in Los Angeles & as more of them are brutally murdered Officer Martinez is promoted to homicide detective , more to appease to & calm the Hispanic community down than for her actual detective skills but what she doesn't know won't hurt her , right ? The senseless & brutal murders continue , can Martinez make a useful contribution to the case & prove her male counterparts wrong ? I'll give you three guesses & the first two don't count . . . ( not that you'll need them anyway ! ) Written , co-produced & directed by Chris Fisher Nightstalker is the latest in a long line of low budget crap that I've sat through recently , honestly sometimes I wonder why I even bother I really do . Anyway , never let it be said I don't give a film a chance & I did at least make it all way through it . Even though his name is never mentioned Nightstalker is apparently based on the crimes of serial killer Robert Ramirez who killed members of the Los Angeles Hispanic community back in the 80's , having lived in England all my life I have never heard of Ramirez or his crimes so I really can't say how accurately this depicts them . The script throws in a bald headed demon that ' tells ' the nightstalker to kill , the fictional cop Martinez to try & have a central character & add a few melodramatics to the proceedings & by all accounts has very little to do with the real Ramirez & has no real regard or intent for factual recreation . I can understand filmmakers wanting to change a few things around & spice things up a bit but in this case Nightstalker just comes across like a really bad cheapo low budget horror . It moves along at a fair pace & I didn't fall asleep ( it was quite late too ) so I have to give it that but overall I can't exactly heap praise on Nightstalker as it's simply not very good & ultimately that's the bottom line I'm afraid . I also take offence at the notion that he killed because of his foot fetish , even if it was unintentional they show him acting out a fantasy with a prostitute just before he kills his first victims which clearly sends some sort of message out , doesn't it ? Director Fisher turns in one of the most annoying film to watch I've sat through , his use of gimmicky editing & MTV style editing & manipulation is irritating to say the least . From stupid time-lapse photography , fast forward , hi-speed , low-speed , blurriness , jerky hand held camera shots & constant drab low level lighting set to the most awful rock tracks you have a film which may literally give it's audience a head ache . These annoying flashy sequences are really unnecessary as proved by the fact the films most effective scene is when these processes aren't used . Forget about any decent violence , a few blood stained murder scenes & a couple of eyeballs in a box , that's it . Technically Nightstalker is OK apart from those annoying editing tricks , according to the IMDb Nightstalker was edited in the editor's living room & that it was shot in a mere 16 days . Neither of these revelations come as any real surprise to me & 16 days ? What took them so long ! ? The acting was OK but did anyone else notice Trejo's moustache ? The one side is fine but one half of the other half was shaved off , he literally only had three quarters of his moustache ! Is this a fashion thing ? Pay close attention when he & Sanchez are talking outside her house near the end , you'll see what I mean . . . Nightstalker is a pretty bad film when all said & done , it's as simple & straight forward as that . There are much better films out there although as I said at least it kept me watching to the bitter end which is something I suppose .
517599	1132073	46242	10.0	Good one with Skemp !	The Three Stooges has always been some of the many actors that I have loved . I love just about every one of the shorts that they have made . I love all six of the Stooges ( Curly , Shemp , Moe , Larry , Joe , and Curly Joe ) ! All of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts ! In My opinion The Three Stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team ! One of My favorite Stooges shorts with Shemp is none other than Rip , Sew and Stitch ! All appearing in this short are the great Vernon Dent , the excellent Tiny Brauer , Phil Arnold , the hilarious Cy Schindell , and Jules White There are so many funny parts here . Dent , Brauer , and Schindell are great here ! This is a very hilarious short . There is another similar Three Stooges short like this one called Sing a Song of Six Pants and I recommend both !
564773	102816	29583	10.0	Marvelous Restoration	I can't believe the clarity of this DVD . You could swear that this movie was made yesterday by the eye popping color . I've seen some great restorations but this is by far the best , even moreso considering that this film is now 64 years old . Disney have outdone themselves . The movie itself is entertaining although it does seem a bit European at times . It does not take place in any particular country but some of the dwarves sound like they are from Kentucky . The abundance of cute animals and a surprisingly cruel villain keep this story watchable . I mean we have heard it a million times before but the dwarves have more character than Snow White who does nothing but look pretty . And who doesn't want the Evil Queen to get what's coming to her . The supplements on the DVD are MASSIVE and too many to even mention . Let me just say that if you are a fan of the film you certainly WON'T be disappointed . This baby is loaded and bursting at the seams . The DVD is in 1 . 33 : 1 full frame and is in Dolby 5 . 1 .
515012	317399	432291	2.0	A Nutshell Review : The Fog	Hollywood has not gotten over its John Carpenter remakes , and The Fog is the latest in a series . From the trailers , we were teased that " there is something in the fog " , but we do not know what . And no , despite being nice to look at and all , the Fog is not at all suffocating . Antonio Island is celebrating its founding fathers , and we're introduced to the descendants of the Malones , the Waynes , the Castels and the Williams . Tom Welling ( Clark Kent in the Smallville television series ) stars as Nick Castle , the hero of the story who runs a washout boat business . Maggie Grace stars as Elizabeth Williams , Nick's girlfriend who has returned to the island and somehow feels responsible for the events that transpired when the fog descents . Selma Blair stars as Stevie Wayne , a single parent running the only radio channel up atop the only lighthouse on the island . Pretty standard fare , one-dimensional characters . What will probably keep you engaged in the movie , is the quest to discover the truth and back story to the entire fog shenanigans . A mysterious menacing looking fog arrives , contrary to physics and wind directions , and strange killings and happenings occur on the island . Age old objects like a hairbrush and timepiece turn up at the beach , and itchy-handed folks pick it up despite us folks knowing bad things will happen . But it bores you after a while , with its usual sins of the fathers theme having little depth ( ok , so it's a horror flick after all ) . It's simple , but with potential , which degenerates into almost a Pirates of the Caribbean copycat in the special effects department . And the special effects and makeup could perhaps be the only saving grace in this movie . There are loopholes in the storyline , especially the ending . You understand what the filmmakers are trying to suggest , but it just doesn't make much sense anyway . Is it frightening ? No . It's a tame pussycat in its scares , relying on cheap , loud , clanging and knocking of metal three times to signal the demise of the characters who hear them , knowing that Evil is around and knocking at your door . Any more , you'll probably go deaf with the theatre's surround sound system . If there's a movie like The Fog which can be made , perhaps someone would be bold enough to make The Mist , or The Haze in local context . Don't waste your time , you'll need strong fog-lamps to attempt to look at the good in this picture . Being a Tom Welling groupie fan , will probably help .
437996	306861	12224	10.0	Mr . Keaton's Mistaken Identity	A BUSTER KEATON Silent Short . Poor Buster becomes THE GOAT ( " scapegoat " ) for a dangerous escaped murderer . This is a wonderful , hilarious little film with Keaton at his absolute best . In what is essentially a series of chases , Buster gets to exercise his endlessly inventive imagination . Big Joe Roberts appears as the highly suspicious police chief . Born into a family of Vaudevillian acrobats , Buster Keaton ( 1895-1966 ) mastered physical comedy at a very early age . An association with Fatty Arbuckle led to a series of highly imaginative short subjects and classic , silent feature-length films - all from 1920 to 1928 . Writer , director , star & stuntman - Buster could do it all and his intuitive genius gave him almost miraculous knowledge as to the intricacies of film making and of what it took to please an audience . More akin to Fairbanks than Chaplin , Buster's films were full of splendid adventure , exciting derring-do and the most dangerous physical stunts imaginable . His theme of a little man against the world , who triumphs through bravery & ingenuity , dominates his films . Through every calamity & disaster , Buster remained the Great Stone Face , a stoic survivor in a universe gone mad . In the late 1920's Buster was betrayed by his manager / brother-in-law and his contract was sold to MGM , which proceeded to nearly destroy his career . Teamed initially with Jimmy Durante and eventually allowed small roles in mediocre comedies , Buster was for 35 years consistently given work far beneath his talent . Finally , before lung cancer took him at age 70 , he had the satisfaction of knowing that his classic films were being rediscovered . Now , well past his centenary , Buster Keaton is routinely recognized & appreciated as one of cinema's true authentic geniuses . And he knew how to make people laugh . . .
558884	2626332	266543	9.0	Great Disney fun ! One of the best , of late .	Finding Nemo was a sheer delight , comparable to Lilo and Stitch , but made more like Toy Story . Pixar has really accomplished a classic telling with this one . Nemo is a small clown fish who is the sole survivor of his clutch . His only living family is his father , as his mother was eaten while defending her clutch of eggs . As a result , his father is a complete almost non-functioning paranoid who would be happy to just live inside his anemone with his sun , and never venture out for anything . This , of course , does not set well with his son , who is your average , adventurous child in every way but one ; he has a deformity which gives his paranoid father all the excuses he needs to closet his child and keep him from the world . Stolen from his father's loving and watchful eye by divers ( probably American , one of the other fish proclaims ) Nemo is taken into the world of humans and deposited inside an aquarium where he will be given as a present to Darla the Fish Killer . Meanwhile , his father races after the boat , loses the trail and must rely on the assistance of Dory , she of the short term memory loss . Ellen DeGeneres as Dory , literally steals the show with her dialog and lines which are hilariously funny . Marlin the clown fish hunts after his son for weeks , swimming hundreds of miles in search of his lost son . I highly recommend this movie to anyone who needs a good laugh , and a good shot of wholesome Disney . I was a bit taken aback by the anti-American line in this movie , considering it IS an American production AND Disney , to boot , but I suppose it is just Disney's little jibe at those who would blame America for everything , when it turns out an Australian was the one who stole Nemo , after all . shrugs I don't know , but it did not sit well with me . But it was just one line , and the rest of the movie was wonderful . It rates an from . . . the Fiend : .
454188	11228318	516	7.0	El Hotel electrico is a fascinating early use of stop motion photography	Just saw on YouTube what must have been one of the earliest uses of stop motion animation in history . In summation , as baggage is checked in that baggage moves by itself to a room where it opens itself revealing lots of brushes that now move out . We next see a man and a woman sitting down before we see the man's boot get unbuckled by itself . With the boot off , a brush moves itself up and down on the front end . We next see the woman's coat come off by itself before her hair gets a thorough brushing-also by itself-before the hair ties itself into a bun . Then comes a scene of a man in front of a wall full of electrical switches . As he pulls one large switch down , we cut to a scene of various chairs and other furniture moving in chaotic ways as the short ends . . . Primitive but still fascinating look at trick photography in the early 20th century . Must have truly awed audiences back then . Definitely worth a look for silent film buffs .
429177	1173088	358082	5.0	Poor animation and simply not very funny or enjoyable	I'm already tired of DreamWorks ' animation studios . They've stolen the ideas of Pixar and created ugly , annoying films like " Shark Tale " and " Madagascar . " Oh , and " Robots . " This one is just as bad as DreamWorks ' other animated films Whereas Pixar gave 3D animated films a good name back in ' 95 with " Toy Story , " DreamWorks stole the magic a few years later with " Antz " ( which was pretty funny ) and then " Shrek " ( which I didn't care for as much as other people ) . At first it was kind of cute and " Shrek " and " Shrek 2 " were good enough ( I particularly liked " Shrek 2 " ) but after that the line kind of blurred . The animation in " Madagascar " was simply lazy and " Robots " is not very different . There are a few moments of incredible landscape , but the features of the characters themselves are hideous and appalling . The voice talents are impressive - Mel Brooks , Ewan McGregor , Halle Berry , Robin Williams - but Williams and Brooks are the only ones who really stand out , and even then , Williams isn't so funny anymore . ( He needs to get back into adult comedy . ) The " in-jokes " are only so-so . There are a few chuckle-worthy gags , but nothing that made me laugh out loud . I think DreamWorks should leave the animated family films to Pixar and go back to hogging all the Oscar nominations .
403158	453228	215750	6.0	ok movie	This movie is ok , it had a high budget , and interesting characters . Except for Ed Harris the movie's line up is full of no name actors , with no name performances . I hate it when a movie is filmed ie like this one where it is suppose to be in Russia , and everyone has a British accent . At least Ed Harris , gave and effort to sound German , and culturally act as one . This gives a movie believablity , and the director should of gave this consideration . Then they have to add all this personal crap , and phony heroics to all ready interesting true story . All these negative factors weighed down a film that could be a 8 , but instead is a 6 .
482696	1293485	454970	3.0	Well , now that Hostel is out . . . I guess every director figures they could do a better job	I was interested in seeing Turistas , from the trailer , it looked pretty scary , and I'm not afraid to admit it , I liked Hostel , it was really intense and scary . But this was just a rip off , only this time it took place in Brazil instead of Europe . The whole story could have been something better , even if it was similar to Hostel , it could have had something special to it , that's all . The problem was , not only the acting , the actors having no chemistry , but the story just didn't work , nore was the villain convincing enough . It seemed like the story was just in a rush with things and had so many plot holes . 5 friends are traveling through Brazil , but when their bus crashes and they have to wait for another one . Another traveler , Pru , helps them points out that they took the wrong bus , but that there is a bar on a beach that they could check out while waiting for another bus . But things go terribly wrong when the gang wakes up from a night of partying , and they have been robbed . They go to a village to get some help , but unfortunately , they are led to a remote house where things could get from worse to . . . well , just a very serious and deadly situation . I think this film tried to upstage Hostel in gore and story , but all in all , it didn't work . The killer seems to be just like a little kid who got picked on too much and when he got older , he went on a power trip . Not only that , but the characters were completely unsympathetic , except for Pru , and the story was too silly and not well thought out . I wouldn't really recommend Turistas , it's just a stupid rip off of Hostel .
385375	391152	14142	8.0	Excellent	This is a Hollywood silent film of great spectacle and emotion . Lon Chaney as Quasimodo is entirely believable . He exudes a supreme sense of pathos . However , I'll remember it most because of Patsy Ruth Miller who plays Esmerelda . She is very , very good . The mob scenes at the end are unpolished - that sort of filmmaking hadn't been perfected yet , I suppose . I also dislike color tinting . I know , I know , that's what they originally did . However , I can't imagine that the photographers liked it , since it makes all their images dull and murky . It seriously looks like someone pulled the print I saw out of a recently-desecrated porcelain god . .
384442	449021	56983	3.0	Pretense is not acceptable .	If for only one reason to watch ; Francis Ford Coppola writes and directs under the watchful eye of producer Roger Corman . Louis Haloran ( Luana Anders ) watches her husband's fatal heart attack and begins to cover up his death in hopes of getting his share of an inheritance . This leads to a gathering of a very strange family in an Irish castle where an ax murderer runs amok . It is strange that the Irish family members do not speak with an Irish accent . And when Anders strips down to bra and panties and jumps into the lake . . . instead of her panties turning transparent , they turn to a dark color . ( This could have been the most exciting part of the film ) . Most if not all the violence is implied . The film has a rough and grainy feel complete with hokey music . Also in the cast are : William Campbell , Patrick Magee and Mary Mitchel . It is interesting though to see the beginnings of a career like that of Francis Ford Coppola .
409653	2567136	66318	8.0	Truss Me , I'm A Cynic	By and large I can take or leave Chabrol but he has made a lot of films with Isabelle Huppert which is more or less how and why I began watching his stuff . Apparently he had a ' rich ' period around 1970 give or take a year or so either way and this entry was right at the heart of it . If he has a schtick it is subjecting small-town / suburban France to a powerful microscope and this is no exception for we are offered a microcosm of a decadent French society as seen through Chabrol's jaded eyes complete with three symbolic witches a la Macbeth . In terms of plot a man , heavily under the influence of LSD attacks his wife and child . She sues for divorce . His wealthy father moves heaven and earth to gain custody of the child . Virtually everyone is dirty . Forget a happy ending . Stephane Audran is excellent . What can I tell you .
510095	453068	486141	10.0	" what's with the rabbit ? "	I wasn't expecting this little made-for-DVD special short cartoon , Mr . Incredible and Pals , to be THIS funny , but it is . It's sort of in a really cheesy , stupid way funny too , and I couldn't get enough of it not only as a fan of the Incredibles but in what it was spoofing too . The moving ' human ' mouths over the bad animated faces reminded me of the cartoons from the 60s - definitely the inspiration - the kind that were featured very briefly and oddly on a TV screen in Pulp Fiction . Story ? There is none , really , Mr . Incredible and Frozone go to stop some Lady-bug lady or other from making traffic a means to conquer the world . The big joke in all of this is there is basically next to no REAL animation here , and coming in the same package as a film so complex in its CGI stylizations and wonderment like the Incredibles , it's a really hilarious , spot-on work that mocks it greatly . I wonder really if kids younger than I will really understand the big joke about it , but for the parents or other adults and teens and others who bought the DVD , the joke might not be lost on them . It's all one big goof , basically , but it's made even funnier when listening to the audio commentary track , where Craig T . Nelson and Sam Jackson - as the characters - comment on this TV pilot that never actually aired in the US , and how embarrassed Frozone gets seeing all of this , particularly with a very random rabbit that keeps getting a close-up to bounce up and down ( eventually even the at-first defensive Mr . Incredible has to stop and says it stinks more or less ) . In fact , I'd say I laughed even harder during the commentary than I did during the actual short itself , as Jackson in the Frozone character really got to some points that I didn't expect , like saying that the creators of the TV show made his Frozone white , or rather ' tan ' . It's great stuff , is what I'm saying here .
419301	1609079	16519	4.0	When you find out , tell the rest of us .	Englishman Reginald Denny had a hugely successful career in American silent films ( in which his public-school English accent went unheard ) , playing brash young Americans who were firmly in the Harold Lloyd mould . In the sound era Denny's career tapered off into character roles , and he is now utterly forgotten . During the Los Angeles riots of 1992 , an entirely different man named Reginald Denny was prominently mentioned in the news . At the time , I was intrigued that absolutely none of the news media called attention to the coincidence of these men's mutual name . . . solid evidence of how completely the silent comedian Reginald Denny has now been forgotten . The 1925 silent comedy ' Where Was I ? ' calls attention to its own antiquity more so than usual for a silent film , as the plot repeatedly cites a specific date - - the 9th of January , 1923 - - in the context of being a fairly recent date relative to the present ( 1925 ) , yet far enough in the past that the hero could plausibly have forgotten where he was and what he did on that day . Reginald Denny plays Thomas Bedford , a successful young businessman who is about to marry Alicia Stone despite the protests of her father . ( Good performance by Tyrone Power , namesake father of the 1930s matinée idol . ) Suddenly , Bedford's plans are scuppered by an exotic stranger , Claire , who blithely tells Bedford that he can't marry Alicia because he's already married to Claire : the wedding took place ( she says ) on 9 January 1923 . Bedford is dismayed to realise he can't recall where he was or what he did on that date . Claire , significantly , has no marriage licence and doesn't say where she's been for the past two years . So far , the movie's plot is highly unlikely but unusual enough to be intriguing . Now it just gets stupid . While trying to retrace his whereabouts on the fateful date , Bedford mistakes another man's briefcase for his own and walks away with it . This briefcase contains $12 , 000 . In a sensible movie , any honest man who made this error would return the briefcase , or give it to the police . But Bedford has to panic and go on the run , thus becoming a fugitive accused of theft . At the film's implausible climax , Bedford has to meet Alicia and Claire both at the same go , without either woman being aware of the other's presence . So , we get that stupid slamming-doors routine . . . where two people keep just missing each other . This is just barely plausible in a silent film , since the audience mightn't start wondering why neither woman hears the door slamming when the other woman exits . An impressively physical comedian in other movies , Denny is so frenetic here that I found him wearying . ' Where Was I ? ' manages to be slightly funny in spite of itself , due to the unusual premise and despite the implausible plot twists . Arthur Lake , who worked in support of Denny in a few films , is good here as Bedford's office boy . I'll rate this movie .
487548	386241	74296	3.0	Dismal " comedy " demeans Fenech	Ugo Tognazzi is a lawyer whose flight to New York is canceled due to extreme fog and he goes back to his house , only to find a man hidden in the closet while his wife appears to be sleeping . Actually , he just sees the man's feet but he doesn't bother to find out who he is ( if he did , this whole cockamamie story would be over before it started ) ; he locks the room , goes back to bed with his wife as if nothing had happened and spends the rest of the movie fantasizing about whom the guilty party might be , while in real life each and every one of his " suspects " turn out to have solid alibis . Admittedly , I saw a poorly dubbed version of this movie , titled " Who MisLaid My Wife ? " , so perhaps something has been lost in the translation . What does come through , however , is a dismal , monotonous " comedy " , with alternately ridiculous and tasteless ( and sometimes both ) fantasy sequences . Edwige Fenech looks GORGEOUS in this film , but her role is very demeaning ; she is continuously insulted , publicly embarrassed and , at one point , nearly raped . As for her nudity , it is limited to those fantasy scenes , and it is rarely arousing . ( )
406849	865972	235433	7.0	Vastly enjoyable hicksploitation sleaze .	When a group of developers threaten the land of three backwoods mountain-dwelling brothers Ezra , Benny and Monroe , the homeless rednecks must resort to murder to defend their property . However the trio starts killing not only construction workers , but also camping vacationers . . . Very enjoyable exploitation trash with nasty drawn out rape scene , rampant misogyny and racist overtones . This low-budgeter is surprisingly tense due to its nasty subject matter . Almost all the characters are despicable , the acting is bad and the gore is amateurish . Still if you enjoyed such redneck terror movies like " Trapped " or " Hunter's Blood " you can't go wrong with " God's Bloody Acre " . I'm really surprised that this film didn't achieved cult status yet .

Lawrence dies ; so , she moves to the " Gold Rush " state of California , to live with her uncle . What she doesn't know ( initially ) is that her uncle has been killed by Indians ( Native Americans ) ; and , outlaw Elliott Dexter ( as " Black " Brown ) has assumed his identity . Arriving in the little mining town of Strawberry Flats , Ms . Pickford discovers Mr . Dexter's charade , and learns of her uncle's death . Dexter demands Pickford pretend she's his niece ; and , with nowhere to go , Pickford agrees . First and foremost , Dexter and Pickford are marvelous in the lead roles . Dexter begins to amaze when , in a barroom scene , he rescues Pickford from the advances of Raymond Hatton ( as Dick Roland ) . Pickford performed nicely when first entering her shabby new home , but becomes amazing when waking in the shed up as a wolf howls ? the two exude an unmistakable sexuality in their earliest scenes together , assisted by fine light and shadows direction from Cecil B . DeMille ( and , watch how the camera places their hands in a couple of scenes ) . As the film moves along , it loses focus on some of the sensuality , unfortunately . A subtle scene showing the leads ' passion would have been nice . Joining Hatton , supporting players Charles Ogle ( as Jim Lyn , who dates Pickford ) , Tully Marshall ( as barman Sam Sparks ) , and Walter Long ( as the Sheriff ) are entertaining . Pickford's last minute way of getting the townfolk to reconsider Dexter's fate is ingenious . The fact that " twenty men are fooled by one small woman " was nicely put , especially since it involved a doll given to Dexter's so-called " little girl " !

577118	1399158	48512	7.0	THE PRISONER ( Peter Glenville , 1955 )	Inspired by the plight of Catholic Cardinal Josef Mindszenty behind the Iron Curtain ? already the subject of a worthwhile low-budget Hollywood film , GUILTY OF TREASON ( 1950 ; see above ) ? this prestigious British production ( based on a Bridget Boland play , who adapts her own work for the screen ) boasts two powerhouse performances by Alec Guinness ( as the proud Prince of the Church ) and Jack Hawkins ( as the wily Interrogator ) . Their interaction is a beauty to behold and one cannot help but be reminded how these formidable actors had already worked together in , curiously enough , MALTA STORY ( 1953 ) and , of course , would go on to do so again under David Lean's Oscar-winning direction in THE BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI ( 1957 ) and LAWRENCE OF ARABIA ( 1962 ) . Although much of the running time is devoted to their rigorous one-on-one sessions ( enough for it to be deemed a two-hander ) , the film allows ( at least ) another fine actor to shine : Wilfred Lawson as Guinness ' jailer who grows to respect his prisoner with time . The small cast also includes Kenneth Griffith as Hawkins ' eager-to-learn subordinate ? incidentally , the latter also appeared in two episodes of Patrick McGoohan's later cult TV series of the same name but which bore no relation to this movie ! ? and Raymond Huntley as Hawkins ' impatient superior . Conversely , the romantic subplot between doubting Communist Ronald Lewis and his Catholic girlfriend Jeanette Sterke seems forced and intrusive ? almost like an afterthought ( whereas it had been far more effectively handled in the aforementioned Hollywood treatment ) . But , as I said before , the film's trump card is its gradual depiction of the evolving relationship between the two leads , which really has no equivalent in GUILTY OF TREASON ( where Charles Bickford's tormentors were various and generally shrouded in darkness ) . Although the main characters and the setting remain unnamed throughout ( lending it a pretentious air of political allegory also missing from the earlier film ) , the controversial subject of THE PRISONER got it banned from participating in both the Cannes and Venice Film Festivals ? although it did get nominated for 5 BAFTAs and , eventually , won a couple of other international awards .

Ethan Hawk is just okay as the brother who knows its wrong but goes with it anyway ( Hawks problem is that its too mannered . or affected . I should have been more on his side but instead found myself distanced ) . An excellent movie filled with darkness that maybe a bit too intense and too dark for some viewers ( and even reviewers who rated it highly but left it off the best of the year lists ) . I'm finding it rattling around in my head , its bleak look making me admire it more than I like it . Liking it to me somehow meaning that I'd actually want to see this again , which I'm not sure I'd want to do ( and not wanting to dwell on the details is keeping me from discussing the film the way it should be discussed ) . Grand film-making from Sidney Lumet . Probably one of the years best ( - reduced to for IMDb purposes because I don't know if I need to see this again )
548955	1111192	84781	6.0	I can see the string !	I remember this movie coming on numerous times on HBO and Cinemax when I was a kid and I watched it every chance I could . I know now that it was a cheesy movie and if I watched it again it would probably be not as good as I remembered , but I did like it when I was a kid . Sure most 3-d movies do the hokey sticking stuff in your face routine , and this movie is no different , but I still enjoyed it . Even though during one scene of the movie you can see the string on the " flying " key . The parts I enjoyed most are the first and last parts of the movie . The lead guy in the first part has to get through various traps to retrieve this key thing . I always love boobey traps . The middle just consists of him recruiting people to help retrieve the two crowns . Then it is like a spy movie as they break into some cults palace that has numerous traps . And yes there were only three crowns , one only had paper , the other two had gems , the forth one supposedly was broken by someone who tried to open it without the key . I don't think this was in the original foriegn version . I think it was mentioned only because Treasure of the Three Crowns just doesn't have the same type of ring to it . In the end many of the characters die , and perhaps they get the stones or not . . . I would say but I don't want to spoil the really dumb ending .
558701	2626332	423294	8.0	Great Fun , Wonderful Innovatives for an Animation , and a Great Cast .	Okay , I like this . I mean I really like this . Yes , this IS another " coming of age " family tale told via penguins . Yes , this IS another animated kid's movie with a " message " told via penguins . Yes , this IS one movie's attempt to defeat a similar movie with its " awesomeness " at the box office . Sony could have actually pulled that one off , had it extended the budget to include some kind of ad promo that would have worked , but as it is , Warner Brothers is the clear winner with a near $400MUS take a solid year after the release of Happy Feet . But Warner Brother's budget was four times that of Sony's , and while Warner Brother's movie is fun , it does not quite have the heart of " Surf's Up . " Cody Maverick wants to learn how to surf . He learns , and finds himself along the way . That is the synopsis in a nutshell . The work seems a little full of itself , but only on the surface . The message is that being the center of things is not what's important . Family , friends , and spending quality time with those you love , is what's important . I think with Paris Hilton out there plaguing the world , this lesson is not insignificant . A beautifully stylized presentation is backed up by some awesome talent for the voice parts , a unique story vehicle whereby the message is delivered , and some great innovative ideas for actual delivery of the movie itself . The style is smooth , if not slick , and the finished product is more than a fun movie . The total sum of its parts is heightened by the blending , rendering this as one of my new favorites ( with Cars , Ratatouille , and Open Season ) . It rates an from . . . the Fiend : .
450881	2093818	386789	5.0	For die-hard Simpsons fans only . . . and it helps to be uncritical	In an attempt to make money off of two popular franchises . . . those being the GTA and The Simpsons series . . . this game was ( poorly ) made . Now , I've been a fan of The Simpsons for the better part of my life . And I liked the original GTA , as well as Vice City . But this is just awful on so many levels . The game , with all factors taken into consideration , is mediocre at best . The control sucks ; every time you're not in a car , you have to run around with bad control over your character , who seems to change directions every time the camera changes , which it does almost constantly ; furthermore , you can only run in the same direction all the time , you can't change direction while running ; you have to stop running , walk in the new direction , and then run again , which is all the more irritating when the camera changes , as you have to change directions again . The car control is also bad ; most of the cars seem to instantly stop every time you hit something , which is nearly impossible not to do , as the cars all turn either too fast or too slowly ; either in a quick flash , which is way too fast , or unbelievably slow , which will cost you precious time , and will often cause you to lose the mostly time-based missions . The missions consist of mainly time-based driving , either racing another car , or racing to a certain point in the level , with usually only just enough time , which means that you can't make one single mistake ( the game actually simply throws more meaningless challenges at you later on , to heighten the difficulty ) , or slow down or anything , and still win the mission . The camera angles are horrible ; most of the time , they're all wrong for what you are trying to do , whether it's trying to walk over some straight line , where falling down will force you to start over again ( which most of the walking portions of the game consist of . . . along with the irritating jumping puzzles ) . The camera is only good when driving , and , as I mentioned before , the driving portion is very bad ( and that's the majority of the game-play ) . On the plus side , there are plenty of cars in the game , if you have the patience to get them , which mostly consist of either buying them at increasingly large prices ( getting to be ludicrously high at the very last levels ) , winning them in extra races or obtaining them after completing " bonus " missions . The cars are quite diverse , and there is pretty much a car for every liking ( and just about every single car in the history of the show is there ) . There are also a huge number of in-jokes , for the hardcore fans of The Simpsons who've been watching the show since it started . The creators also did a fair job of making Springfield , and most of the well-known landmarks are there . You can go to the Kvik-E-Mart . . . in the Lil ' Bandit , the Canyonero or even the Stutz Bearcat . Levels can be interesting . There are also a number of jokes in the game , but it's mostly the " new " humor , which means it's humiliating , extremely stereotypical or just plain gross , mostly . Nearly no sign of the comedic genius of the earlier episodes . I suppose fans of the new episodes will like it , though . The voices of all of the characters in the game are the actual actors from the show , which is good , I guess , but it's more of a marketing gimmick than anything else . Now , are there comical catchphrases and such , said by the very characters ? Yes . And does it get annoying after five minutes of playing ? Again , yes . . . and this time , in italics , with bold letters and yes , even an underlining . Some get annoying after hearing them a few times , but most of them were never funny to begin with . Also , many of them ( along with all of the cars ) are apparently from the last attempt at a Simpsons-themed car game . . . Road Rage . Furthermore , several of them contradict what's going on when they are spoken and they're not randomized very well . The police get all over you if you destroy enough property . . . which is the only way to gain money for the items ( required to gain the 100 % rating , which is the only thing keeping you playing past the story missions , which don't take very long to complete ) , past the coins that you can pick up ( which there aren't enough of ) . They're both too difficult and too easy to avoid ( getting caught costs you 50 coins , setting you back ) . The pedestrians seem to intentionally getting in the way , and the cars intentionally driving into you . . . making it seem as if everyone in the game is against you ( not a good thing to make pre-teens and teenagers , the main group playing this game , think ) . Also , you can't die ; now , I can understand and appreciate the attempt at not including that in a game meant for the two aforementioned groups , but this just rids the game of a sense of danger . And before anyone says that not all games need to contain that , play five minutes of Heart of Darkness , then five of this game , then tell me that I'm in the wrong here . The writing contains little sense , limited creativity and several times , actions which contradict the characters that take them . Rather often , it felt like the writers and level designers weren't on speaking terms . I could spend many more words describing the low points of this game , but I've reached the word-limit on this site . Overall , the game has some good stuff for Simpsons fans , as well as for car / racing / GTA gaming fans , but the repetitive and at times frustratingly difficult game-play makes it barely worth playing at all . For huge Simpsons fans only . I recommend this to fans of The Simpsons who really wants to see more of them , and who are totally in love with the idea of being able to play them and drive around in Springfield . Everyone else should skip it .
437959	306861	24433	10.0	Marion Davies ' Finest Role	In order to gain a huge inheritance , young Margaret ( her father's PEG O ' MY HEART ) leaves her fishing village in the West of Ireland to live with an impoverished , but insufferable , noble family in England . This wonderful , heartwarming - although sadly neglected - film boasts a winning performance from the most misunderstood star of Hollywood's Golden Age . Marion Davies is delightfully playful and quite captivating , easily dominating her every scene . A natural mimic , Davies ' Irish brogue is natural & lilting , adding a further dimension to her entrancing character . For viewers unfamiliar with her expertise , Davies will come as a welcome surprise . In the supporting cast , J . Farrell MacDonald takes first honors as Davies ' father ; he is completely believable as a tenderhearted old fisherman who sorrowfully gives up his daughter for her own good . Onslow Stevens is well cast as the kind baronet who captures Peg's heart . Alan Mowbray , as a local cad , and Robert Greig , as a stuffy butler , both score in their roles . Tyrell Davis is very amusing as a giddy young gynandroid with absolutely no intentions of wooing Davies . Doris Lloyd as Mowbray's no-nonsense wife , and Nora Cecil as an elderly maid , shine in their cameo appearances . MGM , under the watchful eye of William Randolph Hearst , gave PEG a splendid cinematic treatment , with money lavished most especially on the production values of the fishing village scenes . The movie proved to be a hit with audiences , as was its signature tune ' Sweetheart Darling , ' by Nacio Herb Brown & Arthur Freed . This was Hearst's favorite of all Davies ' films . Although he realized it was time , at age 36 , for her to no longer play 20-year-olds , he campaigned relentlessly that she be given an Academy Award nomination . ( No MGM actresses were nominated that year , as it turns out ; Katharine Hepburn over at RKO got the Oscar . ) Time has not dealt kindly with Marion Davies . Almost forgotten today , when remembered at all it is usually as a sort of footnote to history or object of scandal . Her life certainly was colorful , and as chatelaine of America's most amazing private estate she did circulate amidst powerful circles . But to remember her as the bimbo blonde mistress of the country's mightiest media baron is patently unfair . While much of the blame can go to Orson Welles ' spoof of Davies in CITIZEN KANE ( which he was to admit he regretted towards the end of his life ) it must be stated emphatically that Marion was not a no-talent actress with few friends & even fewer brains , whose career was destroyed by her stammer leaving her to spend lonely years in great , hulking empty castles . In reality , Davies was a bright , vivacious lady who charmed & captivated such diverse guests as George Bernard Shaw & Winston Churchill throughout her 33-year liaison with Hearst . Adored by her friends , and a fierce cadre of fans , Davies was renowned for her tireless generosity and charitable good works . Her speech impediment never affected her screen acting and her undeniable talent was evident to any who were willing to access her performances honesty and look past the scandal . Davies had to have been embarrassed by the Hearst empire's relentless pushing of her career . She knew this left her open to ridicule & mockery , doubtless contributing to her scarcely concealed alcoholism . But she eventually relinquished her film pursuits in order to care for the aging Hearst , and after his death in 1951 she showed herself to be an astute businesswoman during the remaining ten years of her life . It is only now , with the passage of much time & the restoration of her old movies , that it is becoming easier to acknowledge the contributions & cinematic expertise of Marion Davies .

555286	1406078	44663	7.0	A portrait of a pioneer in medicine	Emily Dunning was a determined young woman when she decided to go into the medical field . What attracted her to this area of science was a role model she met during a family crisis involving her mother at their arrival in New York . When the mother collapsed , she goes out trying to get help , but there are no physicians in the neighborhood , except the kind Dr . Yeomans , a woman doctor , who not only treats her mother , but is instrumental in inspiring young Emily to follow in her foot steps . This story takes place at the end of the XIX century , when women were a rarity in pursuing a medical career . The determined Emily Dunning enters Cornell , where she is the only female in the class . All the male students realize she is in because the love of medicine , but they are not too kind to her . The handsome Ben Barringer is the only one that seems taken by Emily . When Emily is ready for her internship , she is accepted by a New York hospital . The head of the department makes it clear about his feelings toward a woman in the hospital and gives her the worst assignments . Dr . Dunning accepts what's given to her until she proves herself to be an asset to the institution that has been unkind to her . After an outbreak of typhoid fever , Dr . Yeomans comes to the hospital to help and the two women are reunited . Dr . Barringer confesses his love for Emily as he is leaving for Paris on a research trip . This biopic was presented recently by TCM . The movie , rarely seen these days , should be seen more often because director John Sturges ' inspired take on the life of a woman who overcame all odds against her . June Allyson plays Emily Dunning with her usual spunk , given the subject matter a great reading . Arthur Kennedy also did an excellent job as Ben Barringer . Gary Merrill , Mildred Dunnock are seen in supporting roles .
450932	2093818	63386	6.0	The first in a great series . . . but before it got to be good	Watching this is kind of like watching a drawing by Picasso from his childhood . . . or a home video shot by Stanley Kubrick . Arguably the greatest Danish series of the comedy genre , the films about The Olsen Gang have entertained countless people in many countries . . . as my father informed me , the former Eastern Germany found it delightful , as it mocked authority ( it was permitted by the censors , due to Denmark being a ( primarily ) capitalistic system ) . Actually , when they translated the films ( by dubbing , as Germany and France are two of the only countries to possess too much arrogance and pride over their language to learn any other , including English ) , they had to cut out the character of Yvonne . . . as they simply could not find a German actress to match her . That says something about the energetic and hilarious performance she brings to each of the films ( apart from the very last . . . as she had unfortunately passed away , which was one of the main reasons that it was delayed so many years . . . and was pitifully awful of a movie by most standards ) . The actors , basic plot progression , even the theme was in place , right here , from the beginning . . . it just wasn't as refined as it got to be , through the series . Much of it is just dreadful ; the humor is silly and mostly stays at the level of the common denominator ( though there are some traces of the satire and social commentary of the later films , as well as the human touch , the small details apparent in most of the films ) . The acting is incredibly overdone in most cases . . . even in that of Poul Reichchardt , a seasoned veteran within the art of acting , renowned not only for his film work , but for his many plays in The Danish Royal Theater . The plot is all over the place . . . for an 80-minute film ( most of the later films reach over 100 minutes ) , it's got more mix-ups and complications than most films of three or four hours . In spite of its almost insipid , uninspired simplicity , it's almost difficult to follow , and far harder to recall . The pace is almost constantly , insistingly off . . . as if the film doesn't know when to move , where it's going . . . or how to get there . Some scenes consist entirely of jokes , and many of these are of a comic , cartoony nature . . . the " gang " survive a major blast from explosives , to give a brief example . Anyone who's seen the film will most likely grant that the last few scenes of the film are just about impossible to take seriously . Then there are all the quips ( though , admittedly , some are somewhat funny ) at porno , and the diverse reactions towards it ( at the time , just before it was released , the issue of it was heavily debated ) . . . all in all , this film is just very much a sign of its time . It was made to appeal to the masses , and this is what Danes preferred back then . . . silly , mindless fun . It wasn't until a few films later that this series really started to become sophisticated . But that doesn't mean that this film should be forgotten ; apart from of course an excellent window into the world view of the Denmark of the late 60's , this film should be watched simply to see the roots of this grand series . Most of what people remember of all the good films of the franchise starts here . . . it may not be as refined or well-executed as it got to be , but it's still there . The walk of the gang , Yvonne's rants , Egon's impassioned speech to Benny and Kjeld , the very first heist of the film which is always destined to go wrong ( one might add that the visual of the three , as we first see them , might have been better saved for a later film , or at least a later moment in this one , as it would have a more humorous effect , once the audience were used to the sight of the three as they usually look ) . . . it started here . It has been said that the most important step of the journey is the first . . . and while this is arguably ( among ) the least memorable or entertaining of the steps that is the journey of this series , it is still that vitally important first one . Without this , the world would never have known The Olsen Gang . For that alone , it has my respect . Starting with the next movie , there are changes made . The series heads towards grandeur . . . slowly , perhaps , but it makes it . I recommend this film to any fan of Danish cinema and The Olsen Gang . If you don't know any of the other films of the series ( this wasn't the first I saw ; this wasn't where my interest in the franchise begun ) , I suggest you either look for the good , funny things in this ( since they all reappear , many of them done far better , in the later films ) or give one of the later films ( starting around number 5 , " Runs Amok " ) a chance before or after watching this . There is somewhat little in the way of overall plot throughout the series ( though I advise making sure you see at least one other film before " Runs Amok " , and make sure you don't start with one of the ( 2 ? I think ) " Gang " films that start at their holiday destination ( any real fan of these films will be able to answer that off the top of their head , and anyone who isn't should find out from the films and not this review ) . Not an exemplary start , but does show some promise , evidence of things to come .
395971	2483625	51878	8.0	Debut for legendary screen team	The Long Hot Summer is chiefly noted for the fact that Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward made their joint cinematic debut in this film . One of Hollywood's best personal and professional partnerships , Joanne had won a Best Actress Oscar for The Three Faces of Eve the year before and it took Paul thirty more years to match it for their mantelpiece in The Color of Money . Based on some William Faulkner short stories , The Long Hot Summer commences when Joanne Woodward and Lee Remick , daughter and daughter-in-law of local patriarch Orson Welles give drifter Paul Newman a lift into town . Woodward's a repressed school teacher and Welles despairs of her finding a suitable match . Because he started dirt poor and worked his way up to the top , Welles takes a liking to Newman and pushes , a little too hard for Newman and Woodward to team up . That's not sitting real well with Anthony Franciosa who is Welles's son and sees Newman displacing him in the family pecking order . In fact my favorite in the film is Franciosa , he usually is in any film he's in . When he's on the screen , you don't pay attention to anyone else , not even Orson Welles . Welles borrows a bit from Tennessee Williams's Big Daddy Pollitt from the Paul Newman film the year before , Cat On a Hot Tin Roof . His Will Varner though is a bit softer around the edges , also lends itself more easily to caricature . I think the creators of The Dukes of Hazzard used Welles in The Long Hot Summer as their model for Boss Hogg . In fact it's interesting to see the contrast in The Long Hot Summer and Cat On a Hot Tin Roof . It's obvious to me that William Faulkner liked the people of Mississippi a whole lot more than the southerners that are in Tennessee Williams's work . Almost fifty years later , The Long Hot Summer is still enjoyable viewing and still may be the best of Paul and Joanne's joint ventures .
520996	1162550	378801	8.0	good featurette	Of the 3 featurettes on " Dead & Buried " , this was the only one that I really enjoyed . Stan Winston talks about his work , how he accomplished the various special effects on " Dead and Buried " on the relatively minuscule budget of the movie , why the needle in the eye effect is his favorite special effect that he's ever done thus far . Winston comes off as a pretty engaging person . Plus I just really find special effects to be endlessly interesting , so other people's mileage may vary . This 18 minute featurette can be found on Blue Underground's Limited Edition DVD of " Dead and Buried "

493441	3280905	660877	6.0	An interesting little episode - with a diabolic comic conclusion	This was not a long episode of " Night Gallery , like " They're Closing Down Tim Reilly'S Bar " . It was about five minutes long , but it was quite amusing in it's conclusion . I will add this - the cast given here is erroneous . No witches appeared in the episode and Agnes Moorehead was not in it at all . Victor Buono was a very witty actor - some of his best villains have witty lines ( look at his crooked banker in " Four For Texas " , explaining politely but with some quietly mounting anger to two nice but poor ladies why he can't lend them money because they are so incompetent as business - ladies that he'd eventually have to foreclose on them , making him look like a louse ! ) . This particular episode of " Night Gallery " was actually an extended joke , well performed with finicky delicacy and dignity by Buono , until the conclusion when we realize we never understood what he was really looking for . Buono's customer has set up an appointment at a secretarial agency for possible business . He comes in with an attaché case , and is all politeness and intelligence as he asks the woman in charge of the agency who can she recommend for him . She parades her best secretary . A statuesque blond , highly gifted at stenography , typing , and well organized office directing is shown . Buono takes out a monocle and examines the young woman . He looks a bit disappointed and thanks her , and then asks if there is anyone else . The manager goes on to an attractive brunette who understands several languages , and is a whiz at Pitman shorthand , etc . Again Buono looks at the woman , with a degree of chagrin ( like saying , " Is this the best you have ? " ) . Again he thanks her , and asks the manager who else there is . Gradually Buono's impatience mounts , and the manager's confusion mounts . Each one of these women are first rate workers - what on earth is Buono after here ? After the fifth or sixth attempt , Buono just erupts . " I came here because I was told you have the best selection in the city . " , he yells , " But you parade these second-rate people so proudly ! " The manager starts sputtering out an outraged defense , when suddenly a rather poorly dressed drudge named " Ms Blodgett " ( Cherie Franklin ) comes out to empty the garbage can ( she is so clumsy she spills it on the floor , and barely picks it all up - being overweight she seems to be dropping more that picking up ) . The manager is still talking , not noticing Buono closely watching and examining Ms Blodgett as she bends over , and as she starts doing some clumsy filing as well . She leaves after a moment . " You were hiding the great jewel of your collection . " , a triumphant Buono says . The Manager is stunned and says , " You . . . you liked Ms Blodgett ? " " Why of course . . . she's exactly what I've been looking for ! " says Buono . " But she's the worst secretary we have . " , the Manager sputters . " She can barely file . Her typing is slow and full of errors ! " Buono shakes his head and says , " I won't hear anything against her . She is exactly what I want ! " The Manager pulls herself together . After all , it cures two problems : it gets rid of an incompetent employee , and it gives a difficult customer what he wants . The manager sits down at her desk and says , " Very well , where should we send her ? " In the meantime we are aware that Buono has opened his attaché case and taken some things out . " Never mind . " , he says ( a close-up showing he has a bib on and is holding cutlery ) , " I'll eat her here ! "
548951	1111192	98141	2.0	I just didn't care for this	I can see this movie wasn't that badly reviewed and people have made some good arguements for it , but I just did not enjoy it . The costume was nothing like the comic book and though Dolph looked like the punisher he did not act like him . He was to dreary and slow talking the real Punisher is not this silent and brooding . But overlooking that , this Punisher is always seemingly unprepared . He runs out of ammo quite often or he is stuck using a 12-gauge when he needs a machine gun . The villians aren't to great either , but this is Marvel's fault because they sell the rights to their characters to whoever . The Kingpin or Jigzaw should have been the villians instead we get nondescript mobsters and the Japanese mafia . If Marvel would just sell the rights to all their characters to a major studio they would be much better off and their movies would not be so cheaply made . Look what New Line did with Blade and Fox did with X-man , if you sell the rights to your characters to good studios you get a better movie .
428494	3079504	241527	6.0	What I say doesn't matter	I'm not a fan of the books . The ones I read seem like Roald Dahl wannabes . To me the books were young adult fiction that seems like young adult fiction . This the , film version of the first book is actually pretty good , but suffers painfully from the fact that it attempts to get everything in the book on the screen . I am certain that the film would have been a classic had someone had the balls to reshape the novel into a movie instead of trying to make the movie into the novel . If you want to see a good , but not great movie , and to get a faithful feeling for one of the most successful series of books ever made without having to days reading the books then by all means watch this , just expect frequent draggy spots .
487079	386241	65832	3.0	What a goofy film !	Clumsy comedy with cheesy " special effects " ( if you want to call them that ) and a dumb storyline . Still , this could be considered something of a cult item today , because it feautures Arnold Schwarzenegger in his movie debut ; he is already impressive-looking , and his voice is dubbed throughout by a man who sounds nothing like him ! What saves this movie from the lowest possible rating is its lack of pretension ; the people involved in it must have known that they were making a bad movie and didn't try to hide it at all . For example , when Hercules fights a bear , there is no attempt to make the bear look even slightly real ; it's all-too-obviously a man in a bear suit . ( )
482299	1293485	413099	6.0	More family than pure comedy	Bruce Almighty , the comedy that was released with Jim Carrey was more of a pure comedy type of movie . We now have the sequel Evan Almighty starring Steve Carell . With Steve's promising career , mostly in comedy , this seemed like a guaranteed hit . I didn't get to see it over the summer unfortunately , but I figured I would wait for the rental since it wasn't getting the best reviews . So I watched this movie tonite and I have to say that this film was cute and entertaining , worth one watch , but it was more of one of those cheesy comedies that didn't seem to please as much as the original with Jim Carrey . Steve did fine , I think it was just the story and how it turned too much into one of those typical family comedies that overdoes it on the cheese . Evan is a news anchor turned politician who is about to make it in high ranks in Washington , D . C . But his family life isn't going so well , he makes promises to his kids all the time , and doesn't keep them . One day while he prays to God that he needs help and wants to change the world , God does come to him and tells him there will be a flood and he needs a man who will build an ark for animals and humans to survive . Of course , Evan doesn't believe him , but eventually gets it on how important he is , so he and his family come together to build the ark . But his career is going to have to take the back seat if he's going to get this done on time . Evan Almighty , don't get me wrong , it was a cute movie , I would agree while it should have been more of a pure comedy , it was a good family film . Like I said , I just wished it could've been more like the first Almighty where it was just the most wrong guy for the job type of a movie than a man who needs to get close to his family . But , it's all good , the cast looked like they actually enjoyed making this film and I loved the 40 year old virgin reference , cheesy little laugh . So Evan Almighty is worth a watch , but I wouldn't go for another watch again for a while .

585915	783721	175880	7.0	This movie comes at you like a traffic accident . . .	. . . and you'll likely slow down and look with the same morbid curiosity . A well crafted and well acted flick about a day in the lives of a handful of miserable Los Angeleans , " Magnolia " brushes up against issues such as terminal cancer , infidelity , suicide , drug abuse , incest , etc . P . T . Anderson supercharges the screenplay with enough energy to make its 188 minutes of misery , conflict , and wretchedness pass swiftly . Unfortunately , there's so much going on , character development is sacrificed and when the end comes we're not likely to really care one way or another about any particular individual and are left with only one burning question . What the hell is it with Anderson , the weather , and frogs ? ? ?
450677	2093818	285104	7.0	Less driving than the others , but not bad	This one has fairly little action ( no , that's not true . . . it has no action whatsoever ) and not much driving , but the interesting cinematography , good direction , well-written plot and good acting by all actors involved make it worth watching . The direction ( and probably the cinematography as well ) can be credited to the director , Kar Wai Wong , who does a pretty good job on telling an interesting story in a fairly short period of time . The voice-overs by Clive Owen were a very nice touch , and made the sequences of him following the wife more interesting . The well-written plot can , again , be credited to the talented writer , Andrew Kevin Walker , who is probably most well-known for writing David Fincher's Se7en . As for the acting ; Clive Owen turns in yet another very good performance as The Driver , Mickey Rourke does a very good job as the husband and even Adriana Lima ( who is a model , not an actress ) gives a believable performance , as the wife ( although arguably she doesn't have to do very much in the role ) . The uncredited Forest Whitaker also gives a great performance , as always . The film is thoroughly interesting , maybe mainly because of the directors ( apparently trademark . . . I wouldn't know , I haven't seen any other films by him ) non-linear method of storytelling . All in all , less driving than the others , but not bad . . . just a little less than what it could have been . Worth watching for fans of the commercials and possibly of the director .
490746	33913	78569	9.0	Coming to TV Land !	I watched Benson before I saw any episodes of Soap so I never knew the connection . I remember watching an episode with the lovely Katherine Helmond guest starring reprising her soap role . Her character's date ends up dead and it could be scandalous . Her character turns to Benson for help . Of course , he helps out rather than let his beloved friend in trouble . His character's rise from governor's head housekeeper to Lieutenant Governor is a bit unrealistic but he makes it believable for the audience . I remember him winning an Emmy . I think it's a first for an African American actor to win for Best Actor in a Comedy Series . I remember cast of characters including an understated actress named Inga Swenson who played Olga . Peter Noble who played the widowed Governor very well . Rene Aubernois who played Benson's nemesis . I won't write enemies because they weren't . I remember them being at odds with each other . I loved Didi Conn who played secretary and the man who played her on screen husband . They left before the show ended after 7 seasons . I also remember Missy Gold , Tracey's Gold's older sister , who played the Governor's daughter . I'm kind of sad that it's been twenty years since it left our airways . Friday nights were never the same on the ABC network . Good shows like Benson are hard to come by nowadays .
505299	2911571	217679	8.0	an intelligent movie while still having a high squirm factor	The nerdy son of a doctor has come up with a serum that's supposed to increase endorphins to block pain and generate happiness . He calls it myson ( MY SON ) in honor of the father he never met . When his mother is conducting test experiments on three young ladies with a new contraceptive , he manages to slip some of his new serum into the mix , resulting in the three women having extreme reactions to the drug . Pain becomes pleasure and the more pain , the more pleasure . One narcissistic woman becomes obsessed with body piercing ( pens , awls , jewelry , whatever will poke through skin ) , another ( who loves food ) finds she herself tastes pretty good , removing various body parts for her dining pleasure , and even cooking her hand in tempura for a real taste treat . Most of this is not easy to watch . But the really disgusting and gory scenes are not what this is all about , but when they're there , they're quite effective . Now Eiji ( the doctor's son ) has found himself falling in love with the third girl , who is an insomniac , and who may or may not be responsible for some gruesome killings , it's hard to say ; is what you're seeing real or is it a cactus-generated visual ? Because this young lady goes into periods of rest hooked up to a large cactus in her apartment via what appears to be virtual reality headsets or some such thing . Yep , it's weird , and it's disgustingly gross at times , but it's also a pretty damn good film and well worth seeing , if you don't mind subtitles or nasty gore . , very interesting and different .
368021	2707735	23395	6.0	" Are you satisfied with your present circumstances ? "	Like Hitchcock's earlier film " Blackmail " , " Rich and Strange " contains elements of silent film as a holdover from an earlier era . It features extended scenes uninterrupted by voice , and the use of inter title cards from time to time . Considering the lack of a murder victim , the movie plays out interestingly as it follows the infidelities of a married couple on board a round the world cruise . Some of it works , and some of it doesn't . What I enjoy in the early Hitchcock films is the experimentation with themes that will become a hallmark of the director's style in later years . The use of humor is abundant in the early going , starting out with the choreographed umbrella routine in an early scene . There's also the three shipboard friends that appear from time to time that walk and gesture in unison . Elsie Randolph's running gag as the Old Maid is also a frequent comedic break , that just about runs it's course by the story's end . The troubled marriage at the heart of the story is believable enough , as Fred Hill ( Henry Kendall ) and wife Emily ( Joan Barry ) find comfort in the arms of shipboard strangers . It's when The Princess ( Betty Amann ) ditches Fred and absconds with his money that he's finally confronted with the sham and phoniness of his life by Emily . Why Emily goes back to him is a question mark though , that's not explored sufficiently , especially since she found her own soul mate aboard ship in Commander Gordon ( Percy Marmont ) . Maybe it was Gordon's age , he appeared to have about twenty years on the disarmingly attractive Emily . I don't know about you , but I would have certainly made more of an effort to escape my cabin once I realized the cruise ship was sinking . Fred and Emily didn't strike me as being too panic stricken , with voices not much above normal . The black cat that passed by once they managed to escape was nice touch , though the bad luck fell on the unlucky feline . I guess Chinese food had a reputation even back in the 1930's . The first time I saw the upside down drowning technique used in a movie was in the 1970 spaghetti Western " Cry Blood , Apache " , but here it's used some forty years earlier , and with no malice involved . However it seems to me that the crew of the Chinese junk might have made an effort to save their buddy . The trade off for a newborn baby was a redemptive moment . If you watch the film again , pay attention to the Gordon photograph that Emily draws herself into with a marker . It's shown at three different times , and each time the drawing is slightly different . I wonder why they do that ; was it a precaution against the possible loss of one of the pictures ? A similar situation with an altered photo occurs in " Mr . Moto's Last Warning " . I rather enjoyed " Rich and Strange " , it's informative and fun to see the early work of a director of Alfred Hitchcock's stature . It's not often the title of a film also describes it's own action , this one is indeed both rich and strange .

460525	2467618	36699	4.0	Teresa Wright and Gary Cooper seem to try very hard , . . .	This " screwy comedy " seems very forced . Indeed , the actors TRY very hard to make a go of an essentially unfunny script . And , as a result it doesn't really go anywhere . The idea of a woman finding out she was pregnant after getting a quickie divorce just isn't all that funny . And then , when Cooper sneaks off with the baby because he doesn't want it put up for adoption just seems terribly unfunny and it's really pushing hard to turn this into a comedy . It's really a shame , too , as the actors were more capable than the script and I found myself just bored by the whole mess . Considering that Cooper made so many GOOD comedies , I recommend you see them instead .
393982	2483625	44953	8.0	Four Men And A Girl on the Trail	The Naked Spur is another fine western put together by the team of Director Anthony Mann and player James Stewart . Spectacular location photography in the Rocky Mountains lend a ring of authenticity to the story . That story being Stewart as a bounty hunter on the trail of outlaw / killer Robert Ryan who has a girl a long with him in the attractive form of Janet Leigh . Getting Ryan proves too much so he has to enlist the aid of prospector Millard Mitchell and army deserter Ralph Meeker . Getting Ryan and Leigh back to collect the reward makes up the bulk of the film . Ryan is one evil , but very sly rogue as he works to turn the men against each other . His is the best performance in a small cast of seasoned performers each of one is fine in his / her part . The final shoot out is a really well done climax of the story . Alliances shift and not everyone is among the living when the film is over . In fact the title of the picture gives a hint of how James Stewart uses a spur in a unique manner against Ryan . For fans of westerns and I think non-western fans will find the drama and interaction among the characters entertaining .
406348	2020269	100881	6.0	You're dead , so ? . STOP TALKING !	" Voices from Beyond " is an overall solid Italian thriller , padded with typical Fulciesque gore scenes . I say padded because you'll quickly notice that , albeit very cool and delightfully gruesome , the gory bits are absolutely irrelevant to the story and they just seem to be included because the fans expect no less from Mr . Fulci . The gore occurs during several nightmare-sequences , a totally gratuitous autopsy and through repeated images of a slowly decomposing corpse . The rotting process goes incredibly fast here , by the way . Only moments after the burial , the corpse is already covered in maggots and cobwebs ! Anyway , you certainly don't need these gloriously gooey moments in order to follow the story , but they sure make the movie more entertaining and easier to digest ( ? except if you have a weak stomach , of course ) . The actual story , written by Lucio Fulci himself , is quite compelling and revolves on the arrogant and despicable Mainardi family . The patriarch ? Georgio ? died from food poisoning , but his soul is restless and can't help thinking his dead was a carefully planned murder conspiracy . Therefore he seeks supernatural contact with the only remaining person he can trust , namely his cherubic teenage daughter Rosy . Guided by the voice of her departed father , Rosy investigates the various reasons why the entire Mainardi family wanted Georgio dead . The premise might sound a little silly ; yet " Voices from Beyond " is quite involving and the tension is adequately build up . The film as a wholesome may not rank among his best efforts , but this is definitely one of Lucio Fulci's finest achievements in directing ! There are several highly imaginative scenes to state his mastery , most notably the part where Georgio's body lies in state and the family members come to pay their last ' respects ' . With each person standing before him , we are informed ? through flashbacks - about the conflicts ( read : possible motivations for killing ) between him / her and the deceased . Very powerful ! There are negative aspects as well , of course , like the occasionally poor dialogs and monologues , especially when Georgio's soul speaks ! I suppose this is why dead people don't talk ? They say stupid and cheesy things . Also , you should prepare for a dull and completely UNexciting climax . It's a really lousy ending to an overall recommended thriller . Now then , who wants a slice of eyeball-omelet ?
462842	2467618	189179	8.0	Clever without being preachy but it ended on a slightly sour note	ELECTION NIGHT is a clever film about racism . The film begins with a man meeting a friend at a bar . When the friend says on off-hand racist remark , the first man confronts him instead of sitting silently . While almost impossible to believe , the first man then realizes that the election is being held and he forgot to vote - - and runs to the polls before they close . On the way , again and again , he gets in cabs where the drivers are total racist pigs and are amazed that he's offended - - as if everyone of " us " is in agreement about " them " . This is an interesting idea and didn't come off as too preachy . When he finally did arrive at the polling station , there was a very ironic little twist that made the film and made me think of the saying " no good deed goes unpunished " . The only sour note to the film was the very last scene in the bar - - it was really impossible to believe that this one incident at the poll could change such a good man so quickly . Still , it was a very clever and interesting film . By the way , this film is part of the CINEMA 16 : European Shorts DVD . On this DVD are 16 shorts . Most aren't great , though because it contains THE MAN WITHOUT A HEAD , COPY SHOP , RABBIT and WASP , it's an amazing DVD for lovers of short films and well worth buying .
576273	1399158	35706	6.0	CALLING DR . DEATH ( Reginald LeBorg , 1943 )	I hadn't intended to purchase this Set - and only did so after constant prodding by Joe Karlosi ; in essence , these films are no worse than the lower-profile sequels of the Universal monster pictures , such as the follow-ups to THE MUMMY ( 1932 ) and THE INVISIBLE MAN ( 1933 ) . This was the first of six " Inner Sanctum " mysteries all starring Lon Chaney Jr . ( with his frequent voice-over linking them rather naively with the concurrent noir subgenre ) and featuring portentous - and hilarious - intros by a disembodied head in a crystal ball ! It's not too bad in itself , with the plot overly familiar but fairly involving - Chaney's mind goes blank one weekend and when he comes to , discovers his unloving wife has been murdered ! Of course , he's the chief suspect of dogged detective J . Carroll Naish ( the best thing about the entire film ) though it's the woman's lover , named Robert Duval ( ! ) , who's actually accused - and convicted - of the crime . The characters are all relatively engaging ( Chaney is a celebrated neurologist with beautiful Patricia Morison as his devoted assistant ) and the plot development plausible enough , making for an entertaining and fast-paced 63 minutes . The final revelation , then , is at once surprising and satisfying .
367878	2707735	43733	7.0	" Well corn my pone and chit my chittlins . . . "	The thing I noticed about thirty minutes into the picture was how complicated the plotting got for a movie from the early Fifties . Not what I was expecting from a title like " The Lemon Drop Kid " , whose title character is wonderfully performed by one of my all time favorites - Bob Hope . Hope is his trademark self most of the time with the snappy quips and one liners , but it wasn't just Hope playing Hope , indeed it appeared that Bob actually got into his character based on a Damon Runyon story . With any other actor , The Lemon Drop Kid might have come across as the smarmy con man that he was written to be , but Hope makes him a likable chap , even when he's robbing you blind . The other major curve that the picture throws at you about mid-way through is that all of a sudden , it becomes a Christmas story ! I wasn't really ready for that , and yet right from the opening sound of " Silver Bells " , it all seems to fit together perfectly around a con game to bring home the bacon for Nellie Thursday's Home For Old Dolls . Hope has just the perfect cast of characters to pull off this grift - Jay C . Flippen , Ben Weldon , and Tor Johnson among others , and it was especially cool to catch William Frawley in a role apart from his Fred Mertz character . I'm not so sure this bunch could have pulled off the caper in real life quite so easily , but I think you can cut the film some slack in that regard ; getting there was all the fun it could be . With any of these older flicks , I'm always on the lookout for reminders of simpler times gone by - how about a hot pastrami sandwich for fifty cents ! Say , I wonder too , if you can still get a salami gift wrapped for the holidays ? There's also the era preoccupation with getting as many profile shots of the picture's leading lady into view as possible . On that score , Marilyn Maxwell's figure never disappoints , strategically positioned whenever possible in conversation with Lemon Drop or Oxford Charley ( Lloyd Nolan ) . After a while I began to wonder why she ever stuck it out with The Kid , but I guess every heel has some redemptive qualities . I don't know if I'd make this a must see every year at Christmas time , but then again , it might not be the worst choice out there . It takes you back to a way simpler time than say , " Bad Santa " , and you won't have to screen out the language for young viewers . All in all , a fun picture and a fine effort from Bob Hope and his gang of usual suspects .

409575	2567136	26023	7.0	Master Baker	Jean Gabin was not long out of the Music Halls and had yet to make an impact on the screen when he made this movie so perhaps it is not so surprising to find him singing at one point . Marc Allegret's previous movie was Fanny , the second part of the great Pagnol trilogy so on paper the omens were good . Top-billed Baker had been wowing audiences in the Paris night clubs for the best part of a decade , her husband - with no discernible talent - had crafted a screenplay to showcase her assets and theoretically a good time was had by all and it was arguably daring if not unconventional at that time to avoid the clichéd happy ending an audience would have expected . In a nutshell Baker and Gabin have known each other since childhood when they were flaunted in a carnival as brother and sister despite their obvious different ethnic backgrounds . Gabin was content with this but Baker was looking for love in adulthood and doomed to disappointment . In an echo of 42nd St Gabin ' arranges ' for the talented amateur Baker to replace the star of a show on which he is a technician and of course she scores heavily but having already introduced Gabin to a friend has to stand by unfulfilled . A better print may have helped but I'm glad I saw it without being overwhelmed .
554816	1406078	117781	6.0	On the road	Michael Cimino's " The Sunchaser " , as was shown the other night on a cable station , looked faded . Working on a screen play by Charles Leavitt , Mr . Cimino doesn't add anything new to this genre . If you haven't seen the movie , please stop reading now . The choice of Woody Harrelson to play Dr . Michael Reynolds , seems to have been the wrong decision . Mr . Harrelson , a good actor , otherwise , appears out of his league and sometimes out of character . Dr . Reynolds is , at the beginning of the film , a man more interested in going to higher and better places , rather than treating some of the patients he's assigned to see . He has all the accoutrements that go with his position as a rising oncologist , including his brand new red Porsche , the status symbol of Angelinos . When he is made to go along with the sick prisoner Blue , he gets a taste of what the ghetto is like . He has no choice but to go along for a ride with this disturbed young man . Blue is a Navajo by birth , but he's been away from his roots in a while . Along the way to the Navajo sacred mountain , this odd couple experience quite a lot . Dr . Reynolds doesn't warm up to Blue at all . When a kind soul , Dr . Baumbauer , gives the pair a lift , Reynolds voices his prejudices loudly . After all , he's a man that has been trained professionally , therefore , he doesn't have time for these New Age charlatans who think the same way as Blue . The ending is predictable . Woody Harrelson is miscast in the movie . Jon Seda , as the fugitive Blue , gives an uneven performance . The only one that fares better is Anne Bancroft , in her small role of a wise doctor Reynolds and Blue meet on the road . Just out of curiosity , I watched the credits to see if the production company would have clarified that " No Porsche was damaged during the filming process " . . . . .
433978	2171244	77945	6.0	Definitely some things I have never seen in a movie	This video nasties was known as Prisoner of the Cannibal God in Britain , and banned until they cut 2 minutes and 6 seconds . They re-released it in 2001 . The cuts were presumable some of the killing of animals to satisfy PETA , but they still managed to gut an iguana . or , maybe it was some of the unnatural things done to a pig once they reached the mountain . There is a lot of animal killing in the film , but it is the same stuff you would see on Wild Kingdom , but maybe for a little longer than you are used to . There is also Ursula Andress . Not like you remember her in Dr . No . No , this is the real deal . All her glory is revealed to us . Be prepared for some real gore and sex in the mountain kingdom , as well as some strange action . Claudio Cassinelli , last seen in Flavia the heretic turns out to be the hero in this movie of deceit and horror .
479416	463200	61217	1.0	Liked it when I was a kid . . .	I saw this , like most people , on Saturday afternoon TV when I was a kid . As a kid I thought it was OK . Then I saw " It Conquered the World " which this is a ripoff of . OK - - " It . . . " is hardly a masterpiece but compared to " Zontar " it looks like " Gone With the Wind " ! This is a painfully slow movie with atrocious " special " effects and acting so bad you won't believe it . It's shot on threadbare sets where actors just stand around and talk . Why I liked this as a kid I'll never know . I do remember when I first saw Zontar I was scared ( a little ) . Now , as an adult , I howled ! It's a guy in a stupid rubber suit with three obviously fake eyes ! Man , my standards must have been LOW when I was little : ) This is probably Larry Buchanan's worst film ( although " Mars Needs Women " is definitely down there ) and too boring to be bad / good - - just BAD . Even the usually competent John Agar can't save this drivel . Try to see " It . . . " and avoid this . I give it a 0 !
423306	2248099	67321	7.0	That's a nice monster you have there doll face . . .	Well , Italian filmmakers had ripped off just about everything by 1971 , so why should Hammer Horror be safe ? While this trashy horror flick wouldn't pass for a Hammer Frankenstein film , it's clear where the influence comes from , as the filmmakers here have done what Hammer did numerous times and took the base plot of Mary Shelly's classic novel , and changed it enough to make it sufficiently different . As you might expect considering that this film is a product of seventies Italy ; it's raunchier and sleazier than its English counterparts - although overall , this film is actually rather tame all things considered . The plot focuses on Baron Frankenstein , a doctor that creates a monster . The monster soon turns on its creator and kills him , leaving Frankenstein's daughter - the sexy Tania Frankenstein , also a doctor - to continue his research , while the murderous monster prowls the countryside . She carries out the experiments alongside Marshall , her father's assistant , but when he finds out that she can't love him because of his body , they decide to transplant his brain into a better body and have the new monster kill the original monster . . . I'm a big fan of Hammer's Frankenstein series , and I'm also a big fan of Italian rip-off cinema ; so this is a favourable meeting of two different styles as far as I'm concerned , and indeed I enjoyed the film immensely . The thing that made Hammer's Frankenstein films so much fun was , aside from Peter Cushing , the fact that you could never quite be sure what's going to happen ; and this film benefits from that too . This is perhaps not as overblown as some of the Hammer Frankenstein's , but it delivers a wickedly different spin on the classic Frankenstein story . Another hugely favourable element of this film for me is the fact that it stars one of my all time favourite Italian beauties , Rosalba Neri . Neri is perfect for this type of role , as it allows her dark side to shine through brilliantly . Italian horror fans will also be glad to know that the film features a performance from popular American export , Joseph Cotton as Baron Frankenstein . The plot remains interesting throughout as its all great fun to watch and doesn't require any thinking at all on the audience's part . Overall , Lady Frankenstein gets high recommendations from me !
385773	391152	28212	10.0	Easily one of Hitchcock's greatest films	Ah , yet another Hitchcock movie that is less than famous but then turns out to be one of the best films ever made . Every Hitchcock film that I see just makes me want to the rest of his films . Sabotage has a lot going for it . It is based on a novella by Joseph Conrad , the master writer who wrote Heart of Darkness ( truth be told , that's the only novel of his that I've read the whole of , but I've been told that he has plenty of great novels besides that ; I guess after Sabotage , I'm now obliged to read up ) . The story is excellent . Mix that with great characters played by great actors , and you've got yourself yet another Alfred Hitchcock masterpiece . Maybe this film is not popular because it is atypical for Hitchcock . It contains tons of suspense , maybe more than any of his films besides Rear Window , especially in a sequence where he demonstrates his famous theory that a bomb that does not go off creates the suspense . No , this film is atypical because it lacks Hitchcock's masterful humor . This is usually taken as one of his trademarks , but I've seen several of his films that lack humor ( or at least reduce it ) , and I find them just as good ( I Confess , Rope , and The Birds ) . Instead , Sabotage may be the most emotionally affecting Hitchcock film , competing with the likes of Vertigo and Rebecca . It gives you characters to care about , especially Mrs . Verloc , played masterfully by Sylvia Sydney as a happy wife who discovers the hard way that her husband is a terrorist ( don't worry , no spoilers here ; we find this out in the first scene ) . John Loder plays Ted , a detective who falls in love with Mrs . Verloc , although she is clearly not willing , while undercover at a grocer next door . The best performance is Oskar Homolka's , who plays Mr . Verloc . Only Norman Bates is a more sympathetic villain than Mr . Verloc . We never do see why exactly he wants to sabotage things ( and in this way , this movie is quite xenophobic ) , but we see that he does not wish to harm anyone , and that when he does he only does it through compulsion . He also cares greatly for his wife and her brother . Even at the end of the film , we understand why Mrs . Verloc wants nothing to do with Ted's advances . The film ends with an easy escape , but guilt remains heavy .

Bella is involved with the scheme . Bella told Dean she was not going to sell the colt , but stoled the colt for other reason . I think Dean is going kill Sam after watching the Mystery spot show . The trickster told Sam that Dean will be the death of him . All the subplots are coming together . Rubys big guilt trip at the ending cenments the main story together . ( In my opinion ) Let us hope Bobby can help the brothers out . . Funny , many of the supporting characters never seem to live long in the series .
454811	11228318	46908	9.0	Tasmanian Devil makes a hilarious debut in Devil May Hare	Robert McKimson's Devil May Hare marks the first appearance of the Tasmanian Devil , an ugly little monster who constantly spins around that will eat any animal especially rabbits . When he comes upon Bugs Bunny , however , he's in for a surprise ! First , he eats a pig that's actually an inflatable raft , then chicken made of bubble gum . Taz is on to Bugs , however , when the rabbit tries to pass a barrel with sticks as a deer even as Mr . Bunny tries to warn a real deer of the monster . He finally gets the Devil a bride as he hilariously marries them in their language ! Those grunts alone make this one of the funniest moments in a McKimson short . So once again , like I've done before commenting on cartoons included on The Looney Tunes Golden Collection DVD , Vol . 1 , I highly recommend Devil May Hare .
578084	1399158	198624	5.0	SWORD OF DAMASCUS ( Mario Amendola , 1964 )	I recall a childhood viewing on Italian TV of a film entitled IL LADRO DI DAMASCO ( which , officially , translates to THE THIEF OF DAMASCUS ) ; over the years , having completely forgotten it , I was under the impression that the movie I’d watched was the 1952 Sam Katzman-produced effort ( which actually drops the article ) co-starring Lon Chaney Jr . – but , all of a sudden , this Italian peplum turns up on TV and it turned out to be the film I’d come across eons ago . . . Given the ultra-modest credentials , I wasn’t really expecting anything here but was merely curious to re-acquaint myself with it , if anything for purposes of nostalgia . However , the film emerged to be a harmless enough outing and , all in all , quite a pleasant romp : in essence , the plot transposes the roguish hero of many an Arabian Nights tale to Ancient Rome – typically , he ( played by bland but affable Tony Russel ) gets into all kind of scrapes but is always able to get out of them unscathed with cunning and the help of his devoted pal ( Ferruccio Amendola once again , who also happened to be the nephew of the film’s writer / director ! ) The main villain is a treacherous Syrian merchant who , in cahoots with the Roman governor , seeks to be made the first local potentate in return for revealing the identity of the patriotic rebels . As usual for such juvenile fare , this slimy individual has also set his eyes and heart on the local beauty whose true love , it goes without saying , is our thieving hero . Predictably , she is abducted to the former’s palace and is ingeniously saved by the comically black-faced and acrobatic intervention of Russel and Amendola ( who , in making up their gibberish Negrospeak , contrive to include contemporary Italian musical fads like " Ully Gully " and " Dadaumpa " ) ! ! The elaborate climax involves a free-for-all confrontation between Romans and Syrians and , when all seems lost ( including Russel’s head to the executioner ) , a tell-tale bodily scar reveals the thief’s true patrician lineage !
489775	33913	92312	8.0	Jump for Jump Street	This was Fox's first serious drama . It was aimed at a young audience . 21 Jump Street had a great cast including a young Johnny Depp , Peter DeLuise , and Holly Robinson among the cast members , good writing , and innovative plot about young cops posing as high school students to capture a wide variety of criminals in the school system . The show lasted a few seasons on Fox without network infiltration like other major networks . It lasted long enough to leave its mark on the baby network . Now there are a dozen shows like 21 Jump Street without the cleverness and the strive to be better than just the average shows on TV . In fact , the show was probably the first American drama on Fox to be filmed on location in Vancouver , British Columbia , Canada to cut costs . In the beginning of the Fox network lineup , 21 Jump Street launched a unique way of looking at secondary schools with a great cast . It was never awarded an Emmy which it should have been even nominated for Best Drama .
408939	2567136	64165	9.0	Like Raindrops On Roses . . .	. . . a few of My favourite things are the films of Claude Sautet such as Cesar et Rosalie , Vincent , Francois , Paul et les autres , Nelly et M . Arnaud and The Things Of Life , the film that marked both a change of direction and a maturity in Sautet's career . The premise is hardly original ; a man is involved in a car crash and as he nears death his life flashes before him . In other hands this could be maudlin , gauche , embarrassing or all three but writers like Jean-Loup Dabadie ( who worked with Sautet on two of the exceptional films he made with Yves Montand , Cesar et Rosalie and Vincent , Francois , Paul et les autres ) and directors like Sautet don't do maudlin , gauche , etc and as if the technical credits weren't enough we have actors like Michel Piccoli and Romy Schneider to put the icing on the cake . This is one that stands up to repeated viewings .
409395	2567136	49314	10.0	Now You Has STYL	This movie comes THAT close to being the Perfect Musical Film - and nothing comes closer . The ingredients were all there - a brittle , social satire penned by socialite and sophisticate Philip Barry and tailored expressly for the talents of Katie Hepburn who , in the late thirties had been branded ' box-office poison ' by mid-west film distributors and responded by commissioning Barry to provide a vehicle for her return to Broadway ; wait sixteen years then turn the story over to another sophisticate who just happens to be the Best songwriter in the business , Cole Porter , throw in the best male singer of the twentieth century , Frank Sinatra and you can really stop there but just for a laugh throw in ANOTHER top singer , Bing Crosby , a great jazz combo fronted by Louis Armstrong and sterling support in the shape of Celeste Holm , Louis Calhern , Sydney Blackmer , Margalo Gillmore and John Lund . Okay , you're stuck with a clothes-horse who trained at the Forestry Commission School of Acting as a Leading Lady but you can't have everything . When he began work on this score Cole Porter had already written and seen produced what would turn out to be his last Broadway score , Silk Stockings , and there would be only one more film , Les Girls and one TV ' special ' Aladdin to come but he excelled himself with the 10 songs he composed for this film ( technically , nine inasmuch as Well , Did You Evah , had been written 17 years previously for the Broadway show DuBarry Was A Lady and the ' extra ' lyrics were the work of Saul Chaplin and not Porter himself but that's to quibble ) . If the classiest number by a mile is the last one , Mind If I Make Love To You , a typical Porter ballad in beguine tempo , there's not too much wrong with Sinatra's other solo , You're Sensational , the Sinatra-Holm duet Who Wants To Be A Millionaire , the Crosby solos Little One and I Love You , Samantha , the other duets , Now You Has Jazz and Well , Did You Evah or in fact ANY of the songs . Apart from switching the location from Philadelphia to Newport , Rhode Island , to accommodate the musicalization John Patrick was remarkably faithful to Barry's original ( maybe it was the Sinatra element ; he had previously starred in a musical version of Four Daughters - Young At Heart - taking the role that introduced John Garfield to the screen and again the musical version was remarkably faithful to the original ) and if , like me , you have both versions on one tape and play them one after the other you'll find a remarkable amount of dialogue remains intact . John Lund had started out as a leading man and in Billy Wilder's great black comedy A Foreign Affair he'd had Marlene Dietrich and Jean Arthur competing for his attention yet here he plays stuffed shirt George Kittridge to perfection . With the possible exception of Grace-mahogany-Kelly there isn't a less than exquisite performance in the entire film . Truly a classic .
571365	4248714	83907	9.0	The Evil Dead	This is just another example of the genius , especially with the camera and violence work , that director Sam Raimi brought , before Spider-Man . Basically five young people , Cheryl ( Ellen Sanweiss ) , Scott ( Richard DeManincor ) , Linda ( Betsy Baker ) , Shelley ( Theresa Tilly ) and Ash ( Bruce Campbell ) have rented an empty ranch in the forest for a short holiday . After exploring the basement , they listen to a found tape with a guy reading a spell . This spell unleashes a terrifying thing ( The Evil Dead ) from the ground . It's not long before , one by one , the teens start turning into them . The only teens left over have to kill their now evil friends before they do terrible things . Blood filled pipes , chopping up bodies , raping trees , people becoming zombies and many other brilliant gory effects , this is one of the the best gore films I know , and even being deemed a video nasty , it was the most rented film of the year . It was number 12 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments . Very good !
447406	1048771	59465	6.0	" Don't meddle with the dark forces	Handsomely photographed , nicely atmospheric thriller gets off to a good start with NICK ADAMS arriving at a creepy mansion . . . a nice Gothic atmosphere with plenty of fog rolling in . A gruff greeting from reclusive BORIS KARLOFF ( who wants Adams to leave immediately ) gives rise to the suspicion that all is not well in the handsome mansion - - that someone is hiding a dreadful secret . It seems that Karloff has discovered a glowing meteor which gives him strange powers . The invalid mother of the woman Adams has come to see warns him to get away from the house as soon as he can . " You must think this house is obsessed with mystery , " she tells him . And for awhile , she's right . So is the viewer , even though she tries to unravel some of the mystery to Adams before mutation overcomes her . It's a strange mixture of science fiction and horror - - of Adams ' strictly American accent and the British accents of the rest of the cast . Karloff may be in a wheelchair , but he's still capable of giving a very strong performance as keeper of the secrets who is not careful enough in evoking the dark powers . Something seems to be smothering everyone in the mansion - - so much so that the message seems to be " Don't meddle with the dark forces . . . He who tampers there will be destroyed . " Intriguing tale is slow to unravel , but nicely handled and given first class treatment of handsome interiors . There's a definite Roger Corman influence in all the horror and mutation aspects . In the end , the greenhouse holds the key to the mystery with a heavy dose of science fiction regarding radiation and the green glow . Summing up : An interesting Gothic treat for fans of horror and / or science fiction , given good production values but a story that's often a strain on credibility .
556423	1406078	44000	10.0	Honeymoon in Rome	This was Fellini's directorial debut , although he had been involved in the Italian cinema for quite some time as a writer , mainly . " The White Sheik " heralded the great things that Fellini had in store for all his admirers . It is also the debut of a character that will come to life later on , Cabiria , the prostitute with the heart of gold , the eternal optimist , whose story will be told a few years later in full length . Fellini was indeed inspired for this picture . He was lucky in finding collaborators of the stature of Tullio Pinelli , who will be linked to Mr . Fellini in many other projects , Michelangelo Antonionni , himself a distinguished director , and Ennio Flaiano . The music of Nino Rota adds another layer to this film with its tuneful score . Arturo Gallea's wonderful black and white photography looks as though it was just shot , with its crisp details of that Rome of the early 1950s in all its splendor . Ivan Cavalli , an older man has married the beautiful , and younger , Wanda . They come from a small town and their honeymoon is to be spent in Rome , taking the sights and visiting his well connected relatives . The arrival at the train station captures the chaos and confusion that looks pretty much the same today . The prim Ivan is taken aback when the clerk at the Tre Fiori hotel shouts to take the couple to the " honeymoon suite " on the third floor . Wanda , who is much younger , has something else in mind . She , like a lot of women of that era in Italy , loved the romance stories that were beautifully photographed and which had its followers who adored figures like Fernando Rivoli , the hunk male star of those soap opera paperbacks . Wanda , has been corresponding with the office that handles the production of those penny romances , goes to meet her idol . Wanda , a naive woman , is an instant hit with the woman who writes some of the stories , who tells her Fernando is downstairs waiting for her . Well , that's the beginning for Wanda's fling with celebrity . In the meantime , Ivan awakens to a flooded room because Wanda forgot to turn off the water in the bath tub . Little does he know , but his punctual uncle and his family await the newlyweds downstairs , but Wanda is missing . What to do ? Ivan does everything to excuse his absent bride to the uncle , telling them she feels too sick to go with them . Ivan decides to go along with the relatives not knowing what else to do . The visit to the Pope , a highlight of the trip , has to be postponed . Wanda finds herself on a beach location where some of the White Sheik's photography is to be shot . She makes quite an impression with her idol , who sees in the naive woman an easy prey . Little prepares him for the way everything will turn against him as his jealous wife arrives to the shoot . Wanda , has to find her own way to Rome in the company of a beach goer who sees in Wanda the same thing Rivoli saw : sex ! Leopoldo Trieste , who plays Ivan Cavalli , was the perfect man to play this fastidious man . Mr . Trieste runs away with the picture . The only concern for this stuffy man is his honor . The mere idea of having his good name sullied by Wanda simply is too much for him ; it horrifies him . Mr . Trieste , one of the best film actors in Italian cinema makes a wonderful Ivan . Brunella Bovo appears as Wanda , the young bride . Ms . Bovo is also marvelous in the film . She is a romantic woman who probably is married to Ivan to please her parents . Ivan is the opposite of her idea of what those heroes of the romance novels she adores , must look like . Wanda is horrified when she realizes what her idol Rivoli expects from her . Fellini and his team were blessed in casting Alberto Sordi as Rivoli . This actor was at an excellent moment in his film career . His larger than life persona dazzles Wanda , but he is like some other handsome hunks that are used to easy females who he lures to bed by telling them what they want to hear . The ensemble cast is also excellent . Enzo Maggio , a notable character actor , plays the hotel concierge who is more interested in pushing post cards than giving service . Lilia Landi is Felga , one of the models posing for the novels . Ettore Maria Margadonna is seen as the well connected uncle . Giulietta Masina appears toward the end of the film as Cabiria who is walking the streets where she meets the distraught Ivan and comforts him . This delicious film is a must see for all fans of that genius that was Federico Fellini .
520529	1162550	147119	2.0	exercise in redundancy	Located as an extra on the DVD of " Scream Queen Hot Tub Party " , this short film ( only 35 minutes in length ) has to do with a cave-girl ( Michelle Bauer ) being found by Rose ( Cierra Knight ) in her bedroom . So this calls for a lesbian shower with the strange monosyllabic neadrathal . The Cavegirl has to get accustomed to life in the 20th century after all But wait the cave-girl isn't alone and a cave-MAN shows up ( OH NOS ) . Wait . . . why am I going on and on about the " plot " ? t's just a very flimsy excuse to show gratuitous nudity and that's abundant in this film . However Michelle ( who was approaching her 40's when this was made ) is still the hottest girl in the short .
437516	306861	43428	7.0	A Duck Tale With Chipmunks	A Walt Disney DONALD DUCK Cartoon . The two tiny CORN CHIPS ( Chip ' n ' Dale ) turn Donald's snowy front yard into a battlefield as they fight him for control of his popcorn . Here is another routine Duck versus Chipmunks film , but the antagonists are always a pleasure to watch . Clarence " Ducky " Nash supplies Donald's voice ; the Chipmunks are often unintelligible . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew figures on the sides of his vehicle . Back in Kansas City , along with artist Ub Iwerks , Walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated commercials and tiny cartoons for the local movie theaters . Always the innovator , his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series broke ground in placing a live figure in a cartoon universe . Business reversals sent Disney & Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923 , where Walt's older brother Roy became his lifelong business manager & counselor . When a mildly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was snatched away by the distributor , the character of Mickey Mouse sprung into Walt's imagination , ensuring Disney's immortality . The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut , STEAMBOAT WILLIE ( 1928 ) , a tremendous audience success with its use of synchronized music . The SILLY SYMPHONIES soon appeared , and Walt's growing crew of marvelously talented animators were quickly conquering new territory with full color , illusions of depth and radical advancements in personality development , an arena in which Walt's genius was unbeatable . Mickey's feisty , naughty behavior had captured millions of fans , but he was soon to be joined by other animated companions : temperamental Donald Duck , intellectually-challenged Goofy and energetic Pluto . All this was in preparation for Walt's grandest dream - feature length animated films . Against a blizzard of doomsayers , Walt persevered and over the next decades delighted children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White , Pinocchio , Bambi , Peter Pan and Mr . Toad . Walt never forgot that his fortunes were all started by a mouse , or that simplicity of message and lots of hard work always pay off .
555749	1406078	43686	10.0	War casualties	" Forbidden Games " , Rene Clement's masterpiece , is a magnificent document about the absurdity of war . This anti-war film has given a lot of pleasure to audiences since its release . The film juxtaposes the madness of the conflict during WWII to the innocence of a child who is caught in its web of death and destruction . We are taken to the French countryside as people are leaving the madness behind in search of safer havens where the war would spare them of the tragedy the country was living during those days . Paulette , a girl who is fleeing with her parents has only one thing in mind , to stay with her beloved dog . As her pet gets loose , she runs across a bridge to rescue him when German aircraft strike killing her parents and her precious dog . Paulette wanders deep in the country and is discovered by Michel Dolle , a farm boy a bit older than Paulette . These two will bond with one another in ways that only innocent children would . Michel feels protective of this orphan girl . The Dolle family are poor peasants that are eking a life out of their land during difficult times . They have quarreled with their neighbors , the Gouards . The Dolles accept gladly the stray girl who obviously comes from a different world than theirs . The little girl , who wants to bury her dog , suddenly discovers death all around her . She finds in Michel a friend and an ally who will prove he is a true friend until the end . Michel , in turn , sees an opportunity to show Paulette his knowledge in the ways of the farm . When Michel's brother Georges die , both he and Paulette come face to face with a new reality they can't comprehend . Suddenly , their games take a new turn . The little girl's fascination with crosses and tombs come to a head as they go to the village's cemetery to bury Georges . In the graveyard Paulette finds a treasure trove of the beloved objects all over the place and she and Michel must have them to mark the tombs of their dead animals , something a child's mind could ever conceive . The local priest and the two families are shocked by the discovery , when after all , in Paulette's mind it was a new kind of game in her new surroundings . Rene Clement made an excellent job in this classic that will stay one of the most beloved pieces of film making of all times . Mr . Clement was extremely lucky in finding the luminous Brigitte Fossey to bring to life Paulette . Pairing this young non professional with Georges Poujouly , proved to be the right combination as the two children blend seamlessly together , complimenting each other throughout the picture . Brigitte Fossey , who was about five years old when the shooting took place , gives a performance that perhaps no other professional child actor has ever equaled . The Criterion DVD transfer we watched shows how wonderfully they have preserved this film for future generations to enjoy .
405405	2020269	839880	4.0	Let's All Go to Die in the Lakes ' Lake !	The organizing department behind the After Dark Horrorfest clearly didn't base their movie choices on plot originality ; otherwise " Lake Dead " never would have made the final selection . This is a remotely entertaining little effort , but quite possibly also the most clichéd horror movie I ever watched and it's derivative of at least a dozen genre classics , including " The Texas Chainsaw Massacre " ( original and remake ) , " Friday the 13th " , " Psycho " and " The Hills have Eyes ( original and remake as well ) . Every prototypic twist you expect to happen in a backwoods horror slasher really does happen here , and at the exact moment you predicted it too , and every stereotypical character you anticipate to make an appearance also really does make an appearance at one point or another . Personally I have a high level of tolerance for the use of dreadful clichés , but if you're exclusively looking for horror movies with innovating and daringly creative formulas feel free to skip this one , because it features absolutely nothing you haven't seen a hundred times before . The plot primarily revolves on two attractive blond sisters , Brielle and Kelly Lake . Their last name is either a lack of scripting inspiration or a truly lame pun , because they actually inherit a lake and complementary lakeside motel somewhere in the middle of hillbilly nowhere . The girls gather a group of horny friends and decide to go camping in the area they inherited . Needless to say the testament was only a trick to lure the girls back to their family's roots , where they're required to continue an uncannily bizarre family tradition . There's a revival of backwoods / inbred redneck horror movies going on lately , but somehow these newer films can't accomplish the raw and nihilistic atmosphere of their 70's colleagues . " Lake Dead " tries hard , but the film never evokes the slightest frights and not even the explicit gore has a shocking impact . The bloody make-up effects are nifty , but there's too little variation in the characters ' deaths and the film definitely also needed a couple of authentically perverted gimmicks . Incestuous sub plots and maniacal old ladies don't upset anyone anymore nowadays , so " Lake Dead " is actually rather soft by today's standards . The film stars an impressive number of sexy chicks ( Kelsey Crane , Tara Gerard , Malea Richardson ? ) , but I sincerely doubt long and fruitful careers are awaiting any of them . Oh , and now that our list of little complaints is quite long already , I don't think the titular lake actually qualifies as a lake . It's more like an over-sized pond , if you ask me .
554684	1406078	293007	8.0	History repeats itself	This film opened in this country recently , right after another prison massacre in Brazil , where inmates were killed after they rioted . Hector Babenco's film is a sad commentary on society's failure to turn these criminals in jail , into law abiding citizens . If anything , this film could be a vivid reminder to law breaking people about what they can expect when they have to pay their debt and must serve time under conditions such as the one we see in Carandiru prison . Add to that the horrible conditions of jails in certain parts of the world . Any would be criminal should think twice about the consequence of their actions . Landing in a penal institution is a hellish experience , at best . How can lawmakers of the world think that a criminal mind will be changed by sending them to places such as Carandiru ? If anything , placing these criminals with other criminals in such conditions will perpetuate crime and if the prisoner survives the term , he will be scarred for life . Not having read the book in which this film is based , it is only fair to say that Mr . Babenco , an excellent director , has given us a realistic film about what hell must be like .
548362	1111192	57181	1.0	Long title , it has more depth than the movie .	This movie starts off with a crazy fortune teller who throws acid on this guys face because he won't have sex with her ( and you can't blame him ) . It then features a couple of losers who go and pick up a girl and they go to an amusement park . From there they go into a strip show where apparently only one woman strips , but before you see her you get to see a very annoying stage show . The boy wants to see the lead girl so he follows her after the show where he is hypnotized by the crazed fortune teller and as you can see it is just stupid . I don't want to give the movie away , but lets just say it isn't good . Having to watch the stage shows gets old , but it beats listening to this one dude in the film who has the most annoying accent . The lead guy sort of looks like a warped Nicolas Cage , and the zombies are really just guys who the fortune teller has thrown acid on . If someone is a zombie then they are dead , these guys are not . And apparently it is alright to shoot unarmed people if they are slighty deformed .
572245	4248714	469494	9.0	There Will Be There	I knew it was about the oil business , I knew the lead actor won awards , and I vaguely remembered it was directed by Oscar BAFTA nominated Paul Thomas Anderson ( Boogie Nights , Magnolia ) , I just needed to see it . The film follows the rise to power for charismatic and ruthless oil prospector Daniel Plainview ( Oscar , BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Daniel Day-Lewis ) , driven to succeed by intense hatred of others and a psychological need to see competitors fail . Daniel is told by Paul Sunday ( BAFTA nominated Paul Dano ) that he lives on land where oil-rich land in Little Boston , California , so he goes to investigate , and quickly buys property by manipulating people , and sets up a well . He uses adopted son H . W . Plainview ( Dillon Freasier ) to project the image he is a family man , promising to build schools and make the community flourish . There is the point when H . W . is deafened by a oil eruption , and Daniel just gets him to see a teacher and translator , quickly solving the problem , and also showing his lack of care for anyone but himself . Greed becomes more apparent , and Daniel builds tension towards preacher Eli Sunday ( also Dano ) , and years later , an older H . W . ( Russell Harvard ) has been alienated , and the film ends with Daniel's big outburst , murdering Eli . Also starring Kevin J . O'Connor as Henry , Ciarán Hinds as Fletcher , Sydney McCallister as Young Mary Sunday , David Warshofsky as H . M . Tilford , Colton Woodward as William Bandy and Colleen Foy as Adult Mary Sunday . I will be honest , for a film being two and a half hours long , I preferred the first hour to the rest , after it goes a little less interesting ( well , apart from the ending ) , this is why I have taken away a star from the rating . Never-the-less , a brilliant story with a compelling Oscar worthy performance from Day-Lewis , with great direction by Anderson , and some good moments to catch your eye , definitely one to see . It won the Oscar for Best Cinematography , and it was nominated for Best Art Direction , Best Editing , BestSound Editing , Best Writing , Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published and Best Motion Picture of the Year , it was nominated BAFTA Film Award Best Cinematography , Best Music for Jonny Greenwood , Best Production Design , Best Adapted Screenplay , Best Sound and Best Film , and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama . Daniel Day-Lewis was number 85 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars , he was number 20 on The 50 Greatest British Actors , he was number 9 on Britain's Finest Actors , and he was number 15 on The World's Greatest Actor . Very good !

( though it does have its share of gore ) it's an independent Canadian film , but it ranks as good as most of what the system churns out . for me , " The Dark Hours " is a perfect

This movie takes look at what the world would look like if the greenhouse effect and global warming continued at such levels that they resulted in worldwide catastrophe and disaster , including multiple hurricanes , tornadoes , tidal waves , floods and the beginning of the next Ice Age . At the centre of the story is a paleoclimatologist , Professor Jack Hall , who tries to save the world from the effects of global warming while also trying to get to his son , Sam , who was in New York City as part of a scholastic competition , when the city was overwhelmed by the chilling beginnings of the new Ice Age . In addition to all of the other challenges Dr . Hall faces , he's also going against the flow as humanity races south to warmer climes , and he's nearly the only one going north . . . Another excuse for director Emmerich to destroy new york , , part 3 . the film does start off really well , it looks as if the writers have done their research , as the dialogue is full of rich words that would go beyond most cinema goers heads . but i fear this is to up the intensity of the set pieces that the audiences have paid to see the film , namely destruction . the effects are very impressive , and as usual the dog survives , and a best friend dies . but does this stop Quaid ? no . whilst he's making his way to Manhatten from heaven knows where , his son is busy burning very important library books and fighting dodgy cgi wolves trying to get his girlfriend some antibiotics , with out even asking her if shes allergic to any drugs ! ! the film does begin to falter after the set pieces and it turns into one mans quest , but it's worth watching for just how ridiculous the writing and dialogue goes toward a downward spiral very quickly and the film soon becomes farcical . worth a watch .
584810	1219578	66534	8.0	Bunuel's road movie !	- He who commits sacrilege with an impious movie . - Let him be an anathema ! By the late sixties , Louis Bunuel , who was an atheist , thanks to God , did not take himself seriously anymore . However this work , " Le Charme Discret de la Bourgoisie " " Le Fantome de la Liberté " or " Cet Obscur Objet du Désir " were not that much different from " Nazarin " " Simon du Désert " " Viridiana " or " La Mort en ce jardin " . One thing Bunuel's oeuvre does not lack is unity . " La Voie Lactée " deals with religion . If you've brought up a catholic , if you have a good knowledge of the gospels , it can help you appreciate such a film crowded with incident , taking place far away on a road with two pilgrims on their way to Spain ( St Jacques de Compostelle ) , or long ago in Jesus Christ ' s times . There is an ironical " documentary prologue " at the beginning of the film - a trick the great director had already used in " Hurdes " when , out of the blue , he began a lecture on the mosquitoes . And if the message is not clear enough , the last message reads " all documents , theories and quotes from the gospels " are historically accurate ! In his final movies , Bunuel shows his great sense of humour ; Jean-Luc Godard , he is not . He is so much better ! An intellectual director whose work is accessible to anyone . Whatever he films , a spoof on the wedding feast at Cana or George Marchal fighting a duel with Jean Piat ( and one of them saying " My liberty is a phantom ! ! ! ) because of a disagreement about theology , students cursing the heathen , he rules . Bunuel tackles the Christian dogma : his priests and holier-than-thou characters such as the butler in front of his luxury buffet or the headmistress of the chic girls school are often contradicting what they said before . And the humble people they meet ask sometimes relevant questions ; dig this one : " what will become of the host ( our Lord's body ) in the human stomach ? " . And Bunuel does not confine himself to the Christian religion : " nowadays " , the vicar says , " the entire world is catholic ! " " What about the Muslims ? the Jews ? " " The Muslims ARE catholics ; so are the Jews , mainly the Jews . " The scene of the crazy priest might have been borrowed from the Fernandel sketch of " Le Diable et Les Dix Commandements " by Julien Duvivier ( 1962 ) . The scene at the inn , - perhaps inspired by Autant-Lara ' s anti-clerical " L'Auberge Rouge " - with its priceless tale of a Virgin Mary's miracle and the mystery of the passing of the hours of the night will be used again in the " Fantôme de la Liberté " with gusto . The cast is a who's who of the French actors of the era : Laurent Terzieff , an intellectual thespian , is cast against type as an uneducated tramp ( but the films suggest he might have been a revolutionary man ) ; Edith Scob is the perfect Virgin Mary ; Delphine Seyrig , the future stand out of " Le Charme Discret . . . " has only three minutes to shine , and she succeeds brilliantly . Plus Michel Piccoli , Julien Berteau , Alain Cuny , Bernard Verley , Denis Manuel , Pierre Clementi and many more . Do go on a pilgrimage to Saint-Jacques de Compostelle with Luis Bunuel !
427669	3079504	413099	5.0	Too much money was spent for too few laughs	I'm not a Steve Carell fan . He's okay but nothing special . Completely unremarkable tale of Carell going off to congress and being asked to build an ark by God . Its okay , but 200 million bucks on this ? WHY ? The animals and one big effects sequence doesn't justify it , there are too few laughs . the only real reason to see this is Morgan Freeman as God . His scenes have that nice warm and fuzzy feeling that many people are looking for in religion , though to be honest most of it is just common sense . Still it nice to know that our common sense is perhaps , the way to salvation Worth a shot as a rental or on cable .
401309	7743887	123349	9.0	" That's the first rule of comedy . You've got to have reality ! "	I very nearly did not see ' Hi-De-Hi ! ' . I think it must have been the title that put me off . In those days , the Welsh language editions of ' The Radio Times ' only used to print titles of certain shows without imparting a scrap of information as to what they were actually about . ' Hi-De-Hi ! ' suggested to me a bad quiz show hosted by Leslie Crowther or worse an inane U . S . import . But I managed to catch a later episode , and was surprised to find it written by Jimmy Perry and David Croft . As was the case with ' Dad's Army ' and ' It Ain't Half Hot Mum ' , Perry based it on personal experiences , in this case his time at a Butlins ' holiday camp . Before cheap air travel came along in the ' 60's , these camps sprang up along British coastlines , providing entertainment for working class families and earning millions for their owners . ( As a matter of interest , I worked in one such camp in the ' 80's as a chef - Barry Island , South Wales - known to all and sundry as ' Shag Land ' for reasons I won't go into ! ) Set in the late ' 50's , it began with university academic Jeffrey Fairbrother ( Simon Cadell ) taking over as the entertainments manager of Maplin's , a job he was ill equipped to handle . His staff included resident comic Ted Bovis ( Paul Shane ) , his sidekick Spike ( Jeffrey Holland ) , miserable Punch and Judy man Mr . Partridge ( Leslie Dwyer ) , snobby ballroom dancers Barry ( Barry Howard ) and Yvonne Stuart-Hargreaves ) Diane Holland ) , and the unforgettable Gladys Pugh ( Ruth Madoc ) , who lusted after Fairbrother at every opportunity . Bubbly Su Pollard stole the show though as cleaner Peggy Ollerenshaw , whose driving ambition was to be a ' Yellowcoat ' ( all the important staff members wore them ) . A number of sexy girls occupied these coats too , most notably Nikki Kelly's ' Sylvia ' and statuesque Rikki Howard's ' Betty ' . We never saw Joe Maplin , the owner . He communicated to his staff in the form of ungrammatical missives , which poor Jeffrey was forced to read aloud . " Hi-De-Hi ! " was the campers ' greeting , usually met with the equally inane ' Ho-De-Ho ! . One fan was the late Sir Fred Pontin , who told Perry and Croft that he recognised most of the characters from real life . I always found Bovis the most convincing of these as well as the most tragic , like Archie Rice he was the comedian whose big break never came , reduced to cracking corny gags for the amusement of drunken late-night audiences . He took advantage of his position to indulge in a few perks , and in one memorable episode Fairbrother's patience snapped and he sounded him out : " Lies , Ted ! All lies ! " . As with every other Perry / Croft series , the cast were excellent , particularly Cadell and Shane . Ruth Madoc's prissy ' Gladys ' got on my nerves ( no wonder Anne Robinson hates the Welsh ! ) , but Leslie Dwyer's misanthropic ' Mr . Partridge ' and Felix Bowness ' jockey ' Fred Qulley ' more than compensated . The visual gag everyone remembers is drunken Mr . Partridge spotting a pantomime horse riding a real one along the beach . Looking at the bottle of whiskey in his hand , he decides to stick with it and instead throws away the banana he had been eating ! With its frothy blend of ' 50's nostalgia and saucy gags , ' Hi-De'Hi ' was a big hit for B . B . C . - 1 in the ' 80's , resulting in a massive increase in bookings for Butlins and Pontins . It went downhill when Cadell left to return to the theatre though . I never took to his replacement , Squadron Leader Clive Dempster ( David Griffin ) . Worse , Leslie Dwyer's death robbed the show of one of its best characters . Kenneth Connor was brought in to replace him as ' Uncle Sammy ' . The period setting occasionally caused problems ; in one episode , Sylvia and Betty had to dive into the pool to rescue Peggy who for some reason was dressed as a shark . The revealing costumes they wore were wrong for that era . Still they looked great in them so who's complaining ? In another , Ted sang the Tom Jones hit ' Delilah ' to campers . It was not composed ( by Les Reed and Barry Mason , incidentally ) until 1968 . Maplins closed its doors in 1988 , and the last shot was that of Peggy ( now a Yellowcoat ) all alone in the camp , jumping into the air and shouting ( what else ? ) ' Hi-De-Hi ! ' . I don't rate it as highly as Perry and Croft's other shows but its popularity is undeniable . It was probably one of the last British sitcoms to generate tremendous public affection , mainly because it featured likable characters in a recognisable setting . Goodnight campers !
436018	9938570	32245	7.0	Before I Hang	A scientist devoted to solving the process of aging is convicted of a " mercy killing " and due to hang , granted permission to continue his experiments with colleague Dr . Ralph Howard ( Edward Van Sloan , of Dracula fame ) in a prison laboratory until his sentence is to be carried out . After developing a serum , and with only a few hours left before facing his hanging , Dr . John Garth ( Bortis Karloff ) decides to inoculate himself with the use of blood deriving from an executed murderer , with tragic results . Granted a reprieve by the governor with his sentence reduced to life-in-prison , Garth finds that he's actually getting younger , but the blood from the murderer used in the serum which was inoculated in his veins contaminates him with an uncontrollable urge to kill which places innocents in danger . In fact , Garth strangles Howard before a thief enters the lab , with a scuffle killing the man . Garth is considered an innocent harmed in that scuffle when in fact he was the man behind both deaths . Released a free man , his old friends he wishes to inoculate become targets thanks to the inner desire to kill , one by one victims of handkerchief stranglings . Garth will hope to pass on knowledge to his daughter's fiancé Paul ( Bruce Bennett ) before turning himself in to the proper authorities . But , will he be able to do this before the urge to kill actually threatens the life of daughter Martha ( Evelyn Keyes ) ? Meanwhile , the police suspect Garth might be behind the stranglings and investigate accordingly . Nice little 60 minute B-movie programmer with a fine performance from Karloff as the tragic victim of corrupted blood , an experiment gone awry . Many will find similarities to many films he was making at the time , playing scientists who meant well , falling prey to unforeseen circumstances regarding unusual experiments often rejected by the medical community at large . The " victim of science " theme isn't fresh by today's standards considering so many films have been made since this film concerning scientists / doctors and their attempts to advance the medical field / life through unorthodox means . I think Karloff's sympathetic performance reels in the viewer and the film is nicely produced adhering to the typically blessed Columbia Pictures studio system where even low-budget offerings carried a polished look and style ( . . see " Cry of the Werewolf " for further proof ) . Karloff was always adept at portraying characters far older than he was and this ability is used here where he starts out as a man perhaps 60 or so , looking younger as the film continues . You expect nothing less than excellent when Karloff headlines your movie . I relish the fact that there many of these less heralded films in Karloff's resume still left for me to discover . So often we back his career into a corner where he's known for his Universal and Val Lewton films , when there's a plethora of little underrated titles ready for the viewing public .
453872	11228318	151609	5.0	Molly Moo-Cow and the Indians is palatable but ordinary	Since the summary tells the whole story , I'll just mention some gags . When the Indian hunter takes the ducks away , the ducks each take an arrow from his backpack which forms a trail . As Molly is grabbing the hunter , she kicks him in the head with her hind legs ! And as the hunter escapes on a rowboat from the woman Indian throwing vases , the rowboat is still tied to a rope but the rope doesn't pull the boat back . Instead , it takes the boat's outer skin out leaving only the inside wood skeleton ! A bit more palatable than some other Molly Moo-Cow cartoons I've seen it is still a bit ordinary . Worth a look if you're interested in seeing every Van Beuren cartoon ever made .
469347	1532177	39211	3.0	Too Melodramatic	BORN TO KILL is known as LADY OF DECEIT in Britain and I chanced upon it this afternoon when it was shown on BBC 2 . I'm very surprised at the acclaim it's received on these pages because - With the exception of the premise which did have some potential - I found it a very irritating movieI also take some exception to BORN TO KILL being described as " Film noir " when in fact it's a totally heavy handed melodrama . Even it's American title conjures up over the top images does it not ? The most irritating thing about the movie is the way it talks down to the audience , there's little intelligence or subtlety involved . Every dramatic ( Read melodramtic ) scene drowns in the most intrusive music possible . Dialogue borders from the ridiculous like for example where one of the baddies asks " Do you know what it's like to be murdered ? To feel metal going through your body ? " which is a very strange thing to ask someone who has never been dead , to the painfully obvious where a front door is being violently knocked : " I phoned the police " a character says . You got that ? A character phoned the police , it's the police who are violently banging the door . The audience have grasped the plot point of the police arriving , so why did the screenwriter and director feel it necessary to have an out of view policeman shout " It's the police , open up " ? I suppose the screenwriter deserves some credit by having a major protagonist's fate explained via a newspaper headline in the final scene but for the most part I found this movie completely overbearing . Mind you THE BIG COMBO wasn't exactly a subtle film either and that's a film noir classic
555597	1406078	806167	1.0	Pieces of April not !	As movies made for television go , this is a prime example of the amount of ' cuteness ' the people involved in this film put into this project . Directed by Steven Robman , and it is based on a screenplay by Matt Goldman . Both creators have worked on television extensively . Their effort , alas , was not worth the time we invested in watching . Don't get me wrong , the film will please members of the audience that will find this story cute . The plot involves what passes for a happy family living in a small town . There are Pa and Ma , who have raised three kids , two men and a woman , at the time we get to meet them . The Gilberts are caricatures of what passes as real people in that far away realm that is television . What's more obnoxious is the callous treatment of a lost granddaughter that suddenly appears at the Gilberts and is promptly dismissed by Lil , who had the child out of wedlock , even though the Gilbert matriarch knew about her existence . Lil , the mother , promptly abandoned her to find her own place in the corporate world . This newly found daughter is dispatched to the nearest motel without any qualms , or recognition by the family . Talk about callousness ! What appears at first as a united family is not what it seemed when one first met them . The Gilberts are highly competitive people . Thus , the annual race for the trophy . They are dressed in the right suburban colors to please the audience that loves to watch these type of movies and who will sit through the film intent in watching a cute movie .
384661	391152	120655	7.0	Kevin Smith's worthy diatribe over organized religion	Dogma is probably Kevin Smith's best film so far . It is extremely funny in the same vein as his previous films , and it does a rather good job discussing the confused state of Christianity today . I believe he comes up with a very good synopsis of the situation . The film , though , has some problems . The clashing of serious religious issues with both dirty , sometimes tasteless jokes and hardcore violence was severely jarring . Another problem is that the antagonists and their situation are more interesting than the protagonists . We've seen a lot of stories about people who had to rely in their faith as they are simultaneously losing it . Harvey Keitel's role in From Dusk Till Dawn , for example , was like this . There are also too many protagonists . What the heck did they even need Selma Hayek in the movie for ? She plays a Muse , a deity which isn't even Christian . Her character accomplishes little in the way of plot . The angels were much more interesting to me , and the film cuts away from them right when Bartleby , played by Affleck , and Loki , Matt Damon , both have vital character changes . They basically switch personalities , and the movie actually cuts to a standard scene where Linda Fiorentino questions her abilities ( the scene reminded me of the one in the Muppet Movie where Kermit the Frog went off from the other Muppets to ask himself if what he was doing was right ) . Also , the ending goes on for way too long , with six different characters each having their own reconciliation with God ( who actually contributes to the soundtrack ) . It goes on for so long , Smith had Jay and Silent Bob do something funny to keep the audience from growing restless . The biggest problem the movie has , though , is the abundance of explanation . Smith introduces so many different bits of Christian politics and beliefs that nearly a quarter of the entire film consists of characters explaining these things . I can appreciate the amount of detail that Smith included , but it detracts a bit from the film . Although I have a lot of complaints , the film did succeed in passing on its point , and it especially succeeds in being hilarious . If you did like his previous efforts , you will like this . And if you like Jay and Silent Bob , this is the film out of Smith's four that they figure the most prominently . There was a little disappointment in that Silent Bob did not give us any nugget of wisdom as he does in Clerks and Chasing Amy ( and Mallrats , if you count the blurb from The Empire Strikes Back ) . His two lines are pretty dumb . Anyway ,
517720	1132073	60440	10.0	War of the Gargantuas is a great film !	I am a huge Godzilla fan and Gamera fan I grew up with Godzilla and Gamera . I have a ; ways been a big monsters fan to begin with . I just love seeing these awesome monsters just destroy cities and fighting other monsters . I also like other monster films especially Toho's other monster movies ! This monster film is one most exciting giant monster films ever in My opinion ! The story is excellent ! The Gargantuas are cool looking . I love it when they roar and run . The fights between the two monsters and the army is really good . The special effects are outstanding in My opinion . The acting by the film's human stars are also good . The music is great by Akira Ifukube ! I really love this monsters film for many reasons and its arguably the best ever ! If you love Godzilla , Gamera , and other giant monster film I strongly recommend that you do what I did and buy War of the Gargantuas today !
407336	865972	279730	5.0	At least it's marginally better than terrible part VI .	When calls for her eccentric grandmother go unanswered , Jamie Lowell is shocked to discover that her grandmother's last known address is a condemned tenement building overrun by murderous children . But as Jamie slowly uncovers the truth behind her grandmother's mysterious disappearance , she merely disturbs a powerful evil that now seeks to destroy Jamie as well ! First of all I'm not a fan of " Children of the Corn " series , however the description on the back of my tape sounded good enough to watch this film . Guy Magar's " Children of the Corn : Revelation " lacks gore and scares and is filled with huge plot holes . Still the location sets are suitably atmospheric-the hallways are dark and slimy looking . Unfortunately the ridiculous climax truly got on my nerves . Overall , this isn't the best in the " Children of the Corn " franchise , but it sure is better than horrible part 6 .
405489	2020269	26174	9.0	Heroic swashbucklers and ferocious cannonade !	Nearly 80 years old and ' Captain Blood ' still is one of the greatest sea-adventures ever made . It initially served as an appropriate answer to ' Mutiny on the Bounty ' , also released in 1935 and starring Clark Gable . This film launched the terrific career of Errol Flynn , who only appeared uncredited in other film until then . Captain Blood is a compelling and versatile story about a young Irish doctor , named Peter Blood . After giving medical attention to rebellions , he's sold as a slave to the wondrously beautiful Arabella Bishop ( Olivia de Havilland ) ? niece of the rancorous Colonel Bishop ( Lionel Atwill ) . Blood escapes slavery and , together with his faithful crew , he starts a successful and diverse career as a pirate in the Caribbean sea . Yet , the unanswered love he feels for Arabella never really allows him to be fully free . Naturally , this film doesn't feature as many outrageous swordfights as in later pirate movies , but the decors and scenery are breath-taking and very inspired . Some neutral sequences ( mainly in the beginning of the film ) can be considered tedious , but long and delightful patriot speeches and exiting battles make up for those . Errol Flynn does a great job as the rebellious captain , even though his handsome looks don't really match the image of a feared pirate . Special mention goes out to Basil Rathbone , flawlessly cast as a French corsair . Highly recommended if you're a fan of classic and nostalgic cinema .
490594	33913	71351	9.0	It's Johnny Cash !	When Academy Award nominee Joaquim Phoenix was researching Johnny Cash , he mentioned this Columbo episode in particular . Johnny Cash plays a man who is very similar in some respects to his real personality . They're both musicians and singers but that's it . Johnny's character is a recovering criminal who married Ida Lupino's character who is overly zealous about God and religion . When her character learns of her husband's straying with younger girls , he decides to off them on the plane but survives . Anyway , I love watching Johnny Cash and Peter Falk together . I love the scene where Columbo researches parachutes and goes into the sewing room where the woman thinks she is losing her mind . Anyway , I remember that scene in particular as he tries to figure out how he did it . In the end , it's just worth watching . It's for Johnny Cash fans especially . He would have been a wonderful actor as well as singer .
367934	2707735	31051	5.0	" Well I'll be a knock kneed bobcat . "	Set in 1861 Missouri at the outset of the Civil War , it's a toss up as to how the state will side during the great conflict . Officially a Union state , sympathies lie with the Southern cause , and when news of the attack on Fort Sumter breaks , cheers break out for the Confederacy at the garden party of Dr . Jason Bradford . Roy Rogers and Gabby Whittaker ( Gabby Hayes ) are sympathizers who become scouts for the Confederate Army , and their mission is to bring a guerrilla outlaw to justice . Val McBride wears a Confederate uniform , but his band of mercenaries would rather loot Federal supply trains and civilian ranchers , taking advantage of the conflict to enrich themselves . It wasn't unusual for Charlie Chan films of the same era to make racial references , taking jabs at blacks as well as Orientals . This is the first time I've encountered it in a ' B ' Western . There's a scene where Roy enters the Radford home and is greeted by the black maid Mammy Lou . When he comments that she's looking well , Mammy Lou replies - " Maybe I am , but I'm feelin ' kind of pale . " For a good part of the film , Roy tries to convince his friend Dave ( David Allen ) to sever his allegiance with the outlaw McBride , but the easy money is too great a temptation . Dave and Roy share an affection for Dr . Bradford's daughter Laura ( Sally March ) , though the romantic angle doesn't get resolved by the end of the film . In a rarity for these early oaters , the villain also has a female accomplice . Bess Warren ( Dorothy Sebastian ) is McBride's girlfriend , though the relationship is more casual than close . I managed to pick up this film cheaply on DVD along with another Roy Rogers flick on the flip side , " Apache Rose " . Both copies suffered from poor voice and lip synchronization , and this film was a bit blurry besides . Along with that , the story seemed to drag along with drawn out chases and repetitious dialog . Still , if you're a Roy and Gabby fan , there's enough here to tune in . So far it's the only film in which I've seen Roy sing a spiritual as part of his repertoire . For Roy Rogers fans , another film with a Confederate backdrop to consider is " Robin Hood of the Pecos " ; Gabby's along for that ride too . If you take in this film , have some fun and count up how many times Gabby says ' ya durn tootin ' " .
422660	2248099	67488	7.0	Decent obscure horror movie	The Night God Screamed , despite the interesting title , is not a very well known horror film ; whether or not that's just down to poor distribution I don't know , but what we have here is an interesting and well made little seventies gem in the exploitation vein , though preceding a lot of the better known entries such as Wes Craven's The Last House on the Left . The title made me expect some sort of religious themed horror movie , but actually religion only plays a minor part in the movie and the movie is actually more of a creepy horror flick with exploitation themes . The main player is a preacher's wife who testifies against a fanatical religious group when they crucify her husband . Time goes by and the judge who put members of the group away invites the woman to look after his kids while he and his wife go on holiday . He gives the kids strict instructions not to leave the house while under her care ; which doesn't go down well considering they're all teenagers . The situation gets worse still when they start being terrorised by a bunch of unknown attackers . . . The Night God Screamed is a slow burning horror movie that doesn't utilise high amounts of gore and violence but delivers its scares through atmosphere and tension . The film has a real gritty feel to it and this bodes well with the dark plot line . The film stars Jeanne Crain in the lead role . She's not the usual horror movie star , but she does well among a cast of lesser actors and helps to ensure that the film is always interesting . The main bulk of the film focuses on the main characters trapped inside a house and this section of the film is tense throughout . Some of the scenes leading up to the finale are not all that interesting , but the film never actually becomes boring . The ending is decent and the twist does make sense , although it's not exactly impossible to guess . It is a shame that this film is so obscure because I'm sure that a lot of horror fans would enjoy it ; somehow , however , I can't see it getting a DVD release any time soon . If you can find a copy of this movie , it is well worth getting hold of .
586534	783721	174398	7.0	Only for those with specific interest in Honoré de Balzac	" Balzac " , the 200 minute French TV docudrama , cannot portray Balzac the man with fidelity and be any more interesting than the man himself . And , judging from this film , Balzac was not all that interesting as historical characters go . Though the series beautifully represents 19th century France with perfection in costuming , sets , locations , props , etc . and Depardieu turns in a solid performance as the title character , the teleplay spends most of its time buried in the minutia of Balzac's many relationships with women to the exclusions of countless other aspects of his life and times . A " must see " for anyone interested in life of the classical novelist , " Balzac " is not likely to be a satisfying watch for those interested in the period piece solely for entertainment . ( B )
579140	583640	46908	9.0	The first of four encounters ( five if you're a stickler ) between Bugs and Taz	This is the first of four ( or five , if you include a cartoon done in 1979 as part of a special half-hour Christmas cartoon ) battles between Bugs and the Tasmanian Devil and in many ways it's the best of them . While Taz is really a one-note character in these and was only in five cartoons between 1954 and 1964 , the cartoons are all very good . The ones with Bugs pretty much all revolve around Taz's efforts to have rabbit added to his diet . Mostly sight gags , mainly revolving around food , but Taz has some good lines , particularly in the effort . The ending on this one is very funny . Recommended .
417962	663392	36733	10.0	Great Classic Directed by Robert Wise	The real reason that this picture was a great success for many generations , was the simple fact that Robert Wise , directed this picture and also , " The Sound Of Music , ' 65 , " West Side Story " , ' 61 along with " The Sand Pebbles " , ' 66 and many other great films . Unfortunately , Mr . Wise passed on to a greater stage in the Spiritual World . This film concentrates on a little girl , Ann Carter , ( Amy Reed ) , " Child of Divorce " , ' 46 , who views cats in trees that disappear and invites children to her birthday party and mails the invitations to her own special mail box . Amy encounters a strange old time Victorian mansion and is given a ring by a mysterious elderly lady . Amy has a hard time getting along at school and her school mates and even her parents get very upset with her mental state of mind . Simone Simon , ( Irena Reed ) , " Cat People " , ' 42 , appears once again in this series of Cat People and adds plenty of mystery to this great Class Film . Enjoy .
406740	2020269	95271	4.0	The night he came home . . . again and again and again	After episode 3 without Michael Myers ( Season of the Witch , which turned out a marketing-mistake and a giant flop ) the Halloween franchise urgently needed his charismatic knife-wielder Michael back in order to make more cash . So here we see how Myers all of a sudden wakes up from his coma during a transport from a maximum security prison to a normal hospital . While stiffing a few innocent bystanders , he heads back to his hometown Haddonfield where his little niece ? the cherubic Jamie Lloyd ? is his next target . The decrepit looking Donald Pleasance continues to chase him and constantly tries to make people aware that Michael Myers actually is EVIL ? on two legs . For some reason , this fourth chapter is immensely popular among horror fans . I fail to see why as it features the same old elements like the town under siege , dumb coppers and shotgun-swinging hillbillies . In fact , the best parts of the entire movie are the different shots featuring during the opening credits . Here , we see creepy images of Halloween-related scenery on remote locations . Excuse me for saying it but the rest of part IV is dull ! Most of the killings are off-screen and even the ones we're witnessing are as good as bloodless . Michael is tame and the film takes itself far too serious . I easily prefer the Friday the 13th series and Jason Vorhees would beat Myers without even trying .
515204	317399	493430	8.0	A Nutshell Review : Jackass Number Two	I haven't seen the Jackass television series from MTV , or the original movie when it was released in 2002 . This sequel was originally planned for release here sometime last year in October , but has been shelved until now . Nonetheless I shall unabashedly say that I had a good time watching this , but I guess it will only appeal to those who have a thing for low browed humour . Jackass Number Two consists of various episodes of skits , ranging from the vulgar to the dangerous , featuring a whole host of comedians cum stunt persons who are willing to risk life and limb to capture on film some ridiculous , nonsensical stunts , or craft deliberate candid camera-ish funny moments to either humiliate , or just have plain fun amongst the cast and crew . The gags range from the simple sucker punch types , to elaborate rouses like Ashton Kutcher's Punk'd . Even their own cast and crew are not spared moments where the joke's actually on them , without them knowing . With Johnny Knoxville ( Dukes of Hazzard ) being one of the chief pranksters , be prepared for plenty of scenes with naked butts , balls , and hair from the pubic region . Be prepared for loads of camera focus on the body parts , and bodily fluids from animals are not spared either . If it's not your kind of thing and you dismiss toilet humour jokes easily , then steer clear of this comedy , as crassness just got its ante upped in this movie . There's no joke that cannot be made here , and there's a running one throughout the movie involving an old man , and another on an old lady . No holds barred , I tell you . If you want to unwind after a hard day's work , in need of some mindless fun and comedy , and not bother about plot or characters , then Jackass Number Two is an automatic choice . Just do repeat what they do , in the real world . And if you've watched this already , which is your favourite skit ?
450345	2093818	1018683	6.0	Worth a watch or so	This is a twelve-minute documentary , detailing the work on the costumes of Batman & Robin , featured on the 2-Disc DVD release of said movie . It's a reasonable enough special , and has some good information about the costumes , both design and use . In addition to obviously the crew behind the costumes ( of which Dragon Dronet is by far the most entertaining to listen to . . . he also delivers the funniest anecdote ) and such , the director ( who doesn't sound like as big of an idiot as he does elsewhere on the DVD ) and the star actors ( all five of them ) are interviewed . Silverstone comes off as a spoiled brat , if nothing else , compared to the others , and really doesn't have much to offer in her parts . Thurman isn't featured much . Clooney makes a good point or two , and is more or less just his cool , charming self . O'Donnell isn't bad , and he points out something in the film that doesn't make that much sense , which makes him alright in my book ( view stuff critically . . . if you don't acknowledge some things being bad , how can you ever expect to get anything of a higher quality ? ) . It has something to offer for anyone interested in the film or at least the costume work that went into it ( which wasn't actually poor , more misguided ) . I recommend this to anyone who fits in either or both aforementioned groups . It's good for at least a single watch or so .

If PHFFFT had been made in the ' 30s or ' 40s , it would have been done with Cary Grant and Jean Arthur as the couple ( or Cary and Irene Dunne ) . But by 1954 , JUDY HOLLIDAY and JACK LEMMON were paired once again ( they starred previously in IT SHOULD HAPPEN TO YOU ) , and proved to be a great comic team with perfect timing and good chemistry . As it is , the story is a throwback to the ' 30s and the kind of screwball comedies Grant usually did . George Axelrod's script is about a couple who decide that their married life has become a bore and impulsively seek a divorce . They then settle down to the business of finding another mate and discover that the single life is not exactly a bed of roses . Lemmon is matched with KIM NOVAK ( a blind date arranged by JACK Carson ) , and Novak gets a chance to glow as an airhead with a Marilyn Monroe air of winsome charm but ditsy manners . She tries hard , but the character seems forced and her attempt to play the simple minded glamor girl comes across as strained and awkward . But the show belongs to the shenanigans of Holliday and Lemon as they go through the paces of an amusing script with some laugh getting results . However , the material is thin and the ending is a rather predictable one with Judy successfully resisting the advances of JACK Carson and realizing who her own true love really is . Fans of Holliday and Lemmon should enjoy it , but Kim Novak still had a lot to learn .
498710	1355507	95063	6.0	" He doesn't need a wife , he needs a bank he can bonk . " Dream Demon had potential but ultimately disappoints .	Dream Demon starts at a wedding as the Minister ( Richard Warner ) ask's the bride Diana Markham ( Jemma Redgrave ) to take her vows but she hesitates & declines so the groom Oliver Hall ( Mark Greenstreet ) slaps her across the face , Diana ain't going to take that sort of thing so slaps him back which makes his head fly off his body & fountains of blood spurt everywhere . Diana suddenly wakes up , it was just a horrible nightmare . Diana is in reality engaged to Falklands War hero Oliver & their wedding becomes a big story with two local scumbag reporters Paul Lawrence ( Jimmy Nail ) & Russell Peck ( Timothy Spall ) who constantly hassle her for a story & try to dig a bit of dirt up if you know what I mean . One day Diana befriends an American teenager named Jenny Hoffman ( Kathleen Wilhoite ) who claims she can't remember anything about her childhood but then confusingly says she remembers growing up in the house in which Diana now lives having just moved in a mere 2 weeks ago . Diana continues to have terrifying nightmares , a doll that a large maggot crawls out off , the basement turning into a labyrinth of dark corridors , a split in the wall appearing & starting to pour with blood & both Paul & Russell turn up horribly disfigured taunting her . Jenny also starts to experience Diana's nightmares , but in reality while Diana sleeps . Diana starts to lose her grip on reality as her nightmares take over , is it all in Diana's imagination ? Is the sudden appearance of Jenny a mere coincidence ? Is the house somehow involved ? Is there a purpose to these gruesome nightmares ? You will have to watch it to find out . . . This British produced film was co-written & directed by Harley Cokeliss & while I thought Dream Demon had potential it ultimately disappoints . The script by Cokeliss & Christopher Wicking is at fault here , basically it's one big unexplained mess . Even now I simply don't know what really happened & I finished watching it mere hours ago , where do the two newspaper journalists come into it ? What were their purpose & why do they just walk off at the end discussing fast food ? Why does not one single person die during the entire film ? Where's the horror & threat ? Why does Jenny not remember anything about her childhood but specifically remembers the exact house she grew up in in London ? I mean London is a pretty big place you know & considering she can't remember anything else . . . What were the meaning & purpose of these nightmares ? I know it recounts the house's past but why ? Nothing is put right , nothing is avenged , nothing is resolved & at the end nothing has changed from when Dream Demon started . One final baffling question , does anyone else think Kathleen Wilhoite looks like a man ? That jaw line , that nose & her face in general screams transvestite ! On the positive side director Cokeliss manages to create some terrific sequences , I absolutely love that wedding scene at the beginning ! The scenes that feature the disfigured Paul & Russell are pretty creepy especially a scene in a lift , I don't know what they did to Jimmy Nail to make him look the way he did but he gave me the creeps big time ! It moves along at a nice pace but for the first hour or so it's just Diana having a nightmare , waking up & telling people about it & then having another nightmare , waking up again & telling people that she's had another one , & so this pattern continues for over an hour & I found it started to become dull as I wanted some sort of explanation of what was going on . The slightest hint of a story would have helped , there are also various plot threads that are left unexplored like the possible child abuse suffered by Jenny , the Angel symbolism , the two-timing fiancé & Diana's virginity & marital fears . There are some impressive gore effects too , the aforementioned decapitation at the wedding , a fist punched through someones head & some gory make-up effects plastered on Spall including him having his ear pulled off . It's just a shame there wasn't more of them & that ultimately they were all only dreams & everyone in the film survives . With a modest budget of about £3 , 000 , 000 Dream Demon has nice production design & is well made with a certain class & the late 80's London setting makes it feel a little different . The acting is surprisingly strong throughout except Kathleen Wilhoite , now I have nothing against her but she does look like a bloke & she is both terrible & annoying in her role , urgh . Well what can I say to sum up ? There is no dream demon that the title refers to , it has a very loose poorly thought out story which is confusing & when all said & done Dream Demon disappointed & in no way could be described as the British A Nightmare on Elm Street ( 1984 ) . It's unusual & has some great ideas & individual scenes but isn't something that I could recommend to the casual film-goer , however die-hard horror fans would probably get something out of it but just don't expect too much .
573402	4532636	443453	8.0	A Hilarious ( and Much Needed ) Assault on Decency	Sacha Baron Cohen comes to America in the guise of Borat Sagdiyev and wreaks his own brand of Kazakhi havoc in this very very funny film . In our age of uber-political correctness , " Borat " comes sweeping through like a brisk and refreshing wind , completely bounding over every cultural taboo we've erected around ourselves . Thus , no one is safe : Borat takes on Jews , blacks , gays , feminists , middle-Americans , religious fanatics , frat boys . The only weapon against the bumbling Borat is a sense of humour , which this movie shows most Americans painfully lack . Indeed , if there is any message to be had from " Borat " ( and I'm not sure there is much of one , beyond its fascinating cultural experiments ) , it's that everyone needs to lighten up and not take themselves so seriously . The image of Americans projected in this film varies from the heartwarming to the downright frightening . New Yorkers threaten Borat with physical violence when he approaches them on a subway . Feminists walk out on him when they find his views on women too much to tolerate . Folks out in the heartland commiserate with him over his hatred of gays and Jews ; a gun shop owner even helps him pick out the best weapon for shooting Jewish people . A sweet Jewish couple give him a place to sleep , and bring him a homey meal ( that is , before they turn into invading cockroaches ) . A group of manic Pentecosts help him find Jesus . An RV full of frat boys make complete asses of themselves by espousing their hopelessly ill-informed views on minorities in our country and the need to revert to slavery . The majority of people treat Borat in the condescending way of those who want to think of themselves as being culturally aware without really knowing anything at all about other cultures . These people become rude the second Borat offends their sense of propriety . On the other hand , the disenfranchised of America greet Borat with open arms , and we see a group of gays and a group of blacks interacting with him as if no cultural boundaries existed at all . The film's sweetest ( and most unexpectedly so ) moments come from Borat's befriending of a black prostitute . Of course , this is a carefully crafted work of fiction , and Cohen only lets his audience see what he wants them to see . I would probably react much the same as many of the people in this film if this crazy-looking and sounding man appeared out of nowhere and began to antagonize me . But the movie does make Americans look like a bunch of awfully self-important , uptight stiffs , and I've been to enough places in this country and met enough people to realize that the way events play out in this film ( even if they are manipulated or staged ) probably come very close to the real thing . Thank God for movies like " Borat . " If nothing else , they remind us that our cultural boundaries only matter as much as we let them , and that all of the fears that govern political correctness are mostly ungrounded . After all , virtually every person in this film was offended at one point or another , and as far as I can tell , all of them lived to tell about it .
382080	449021	337921	8.0	A random call for help .	David Ellis directs this stressful action thriller . School teacher Jessica Martin ( Kim Basinger ) is kidnapped in order to find her husband . Jessica crudely assembles a shattered phone in the attic she is being held . Her efforts result in a random call to the cell phone of a young man Ryan ( Chris Evans ) . She begs pleading for the safety of her son and husband . Ryan begins a frantic search against time to find her . Why are the kidnappers so ruthless in the hopes of attaining what Jessica's husband ( Adam Taylor Gordon ) has in his possession ? Helping Ryan is a 27 year veteran cop ( William H . Macy ) , who just wants to retire and own a health spa . Pretty much non-stop action with little time to rest . This movie is a lot better than what you may have expected .

430168	1173088	318997	1.0	Too long , too underdeveloped , too weird , and too darn politically correct for my own personal liking , although I'm sure many people will enjoy it ( particularly those who liked " Brazil " ) . . .	Prior expectations can make or break a movie . Oh , how they broke this one ! I thought this movie was going to be about angels visiting America . I didn't like what I saw in the adverts , but Al Pacino and Meryl Streep and Emma Thompson were in it ! By George , I had to see it ! To not do so would be a sin , right ? Too bad they don't stress on the advertisements that this is arguably Al Pacino's worst performance since " Gigli " ( wasn't that just last year ? ) , and one of the worst of his entire career . Not only that , but the film barely even features Pacino , Streep and Thompson at all in its six-and-a-half-hour running time . I don't mind that , but when you advertise actors all over a film to draw mass markets , don't exaggerate . It's called false marketing . Instead of the top-notch cast , we are treated to Ben Shenkman and some other various actors portraying gay man in Reagan-era America , circa 1985 . Essentially their various stories intertwined through one main idea ( AIDs and homosexuality in the 80s ) , the film quickly becomes strange and tiring thanks to a truly mind-shattering 6 . 5-hour running time . This isn't badly made . I'm sure many people will enjoy it . But for me , it was too strange . I'm not a fan of " Brazil " for the same reason - - I just don't always like very weird films . It's not that I have a closed mind - - I often try . It's just a little trait inside me . I get turned off by them as soon as they start trying to twist and turn the world upside down . ( There are rare exceptions where I like this , such as in " Adaptation , " but more often than not I am disappointed . ) The movie is beautifully shot , for what it's worth , and that is why I give it a recommendation - - and that alone . I can't commend the performances in this film because they're all borderline mediocre . In one of the earliest scenes - - the introduction of Al Pacino's character - - I had to wonder if this was the same great actor who brought Michael Corleone and Tony Montana to life in the past few decades . Ray Cohn ( Pacino ) is a hot-shot " up yours " lawyer - - you know , the kind who make fun of you behind your back and think they're " all that . " ( Not that I've ever met a lawyer like that before - - I just see ' em in the movies portrayed this way . Big cliché , or small one ? Grisham writes lawyers this way , so I guess it has to be true , right ? ) The movie's primary focus , as I mentioned before , are its two leads : Prior Walter ( Justin Kirk ) and Louis Ironson ( Ben Shenkman ) , two gay lovers hiding in a semi-closed closet , only open to their close friends and family . Louis , a Jew , is shunned upon by his family at his grandmother's funeral . And when Prior reveals that he is infected with AIDS , everything goes wrong . Louis leaves Prior for a closeted homo , Joe Pitt ( Patrick Wilson ) . Joe's wife , Harper ( Mary-Louise Parker ) , has no idea about his homosexuality - - until he confesses and leaves her for Louis , who has now turned into a sort of carefree homosexual . When he's having sex with an anonymous guy in a park and their " protection " breaks , he doesn't care . " Go ahead , infect me , " he says . This scene made me want to vomit , to be honest . Meanwhile , Ray also becomes infected with AIDS , and tries to keep everything a secret between him and his intimidated doctor ( James Cromwell in the best performance of the film ) . There are also a few angels who seem to visit these people in their hallucinatory dreams , but these entire sequences are extremely strange , and turned off myself and two other viewers from enjoying the film at all . They're beautifully filmed , but little else . This is a six-and-a-half-hour film , so to divulge into the extended plot seems pointless . I've basically gone through the entire first half of the program , leaving the second half up to you in case you feel a need to watch it . The film is directed by Mike Nichols ( " Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf ? " ) , which is surprising , because the film is essentially empty . Tony Kushner adapted the screenplay from his own stage play , and at a whopping six point five hours it still fails to ( a ) develop characters and ( b ) provide any interesting scenes . It just trudges on and on , really losing steam in the final act . I liked this film , to a certain degree . I liked the beautiful cinematography . I liked most of the first half . I liked the way it felt more like a film than a miniseries , in most respects . I liked a visitation scene by Emma Thompson in which she has " holy sex " with a gay man . This was all fine . I didn't like the film's emptiness , its lack of character and story progression , the false advertising of Al Pacino and Meryl Streep , the bizarre dream sequences , and I especially didn't like the preachy homosexual subtext of the entire motion picture . It's too long , too underdeveloped , too weird , and too darn politically correct . But if I were to grade this film on its technical aspects , it would get a complete five-star rating . Excellent set design and lighting . Very eerie and bizarre - - despite my personal dislike for such sequences . For its cinematography , and that alone , " Angels in America " gets a recommendation . The reason it didn't get a full five-star rating should be pretty apparent to you by now if you've managed to read this far , which I somewhat doubt . It's pretty depressing to know you're in a minority - - especially when it comes to stuff like this . stars . - John Ulmer
491982	3280905	192336	7.0	A Long Forgotten Television Viewing	It is many years since I saw this television show - which was a special done in the U . S . Juliet Mills was hostess , but Michael Redgrave played the part of the ghost or spirit of Charles Dickens , talking about his career and works . Because it is so long ago I really have problems remembering the program , except for the last fifteen minutes . Dickens meant " Christmas " to many Americans and Englishman in his day to ours , due to his " Christmas Novels " like " A Christmas Carol " and " The Chimes " . Mills brings it up , and Redgrave says he doesn't mind discussing some of his Christmas works , but he'd prefer not to do " A Christmas Carol " because it has been done to death . So instead , he decides to tell a lesser story . Unfortunately this is a chancy gamble , because some minor stories are dull . Instead of choosing " The Chimes " or " The Cricket On The Hearth " , Dickens tells a story called THE SEVEN POOR TRAVELERS , which is about seven poor people traveling in the Christmas season in London and taking advantage of a religious charity . As a mildly interesting account of a fact of Victorian life it is worth noting , but the story was really dull . Still it was nice to see another of the " Christmas Novels " told to the public . For that reason and Redgrave and Mills good performances , I give the show a " 7 " out of " 10 " , but I wish they had done " The Chimes " or " The Haunted Man And The Ghost's Bargain " instead .
401685	7743887	641225	10.0	Which way did Donald Sutherland go ? Straight to the top !	Like Colin Blakely , Donald Sutherland was one of the few actors to make a return appearance - as another character - in this show , his first was as drunken ' Willard ' in ' Day Of Execution ' , here he plays ' Keith Earle ' , a newly-released convict who's as mad as hell . He has served a five-year sentence for his part in a gold bullion robbery , but now he's out and wants his share of the hidden loot . His fellow robbers did not get caught , so one by one he tracks them down ( using a motorcycle as transport ) , roughs them up and kills them , rather like the Lee Marvin character in ' Point Blank ! ' ( 1967 ) . McGill's involvement starts when garage owner Eddy ( J . G . Devlin ) finds a group photo taken just before the lads pulled the job . Eddy wants Mac to find the gold first , so they can split it . But Mac is not alone in tracking Earle . Scotland Yard are interested in recovering the money too . . . Written by Francis Megahy and Bernie Coooper - also responsible for the excellent ' Brainwash ' - this is an exciting yarn , directed by Freddie Francis , a noted cinematographer who , like Jack Cardiff , switched to making films . He is best remembered for Hammer horror classics such as ' Dracula Has Risen From The Grave ' and one of my favourite Amicus anthology films ' Torture Garden ' . He found time to work in television , pitching in episodes of , amongst other things , ' The Saint ' , ' The Champions ' , and , of course , this show . The plot is hampered by a few implausibilities ; why have the robbers all stayed in England where Earle can easily find them ? And why don't any of them head for the hills when the news of Earle's attack on a detective ( Michael Hawkins ) is reported in the press ? Sutherland's delivery of lines like ' I did five years ' bird ! ' sound bizarre coming from a Canadian . Perhaps the role was written for an English actor . He gives the character a sinister laugh which might have come in handy had he guested on ' Batman ' . It feels strange to watch this now knowing that Sutherland went on to become one of the world's biggest movie stars , while Richard Bradford , who plays ' McGill ' , did not . That's show business , I suppose . The lovely Jennifer Jayne is ' Joy ' , the girlfriend of one of the robbers who harbours a guilty secret - she knows where the gold is to be found . Francis must have liked working with her ; she also appears in his ' Dr . Terrors ' House Of Horrors ' ( as does Sutherland ) ( 1964 ) and the ludicrous but enjoyable sci-fi film ' They Came From Beyond Space ' ( 1967 ) . Irish actor J . G . Devlin , who plays ' Eddy ' , was one of the two escaped convicts ( Leonard Rossiter was the other ) who invaded Oil Drum Lane in the classic ' Steptoe & Son ' episode ' The Desperate Hours ' .
385763	391152	29339	10.0	Nine of the most beautiful minutes ever put to film	The Old Mill was a Silly Symphony developed as a test for Snow White and the Seven Dwarves , which was just going into production at the time . What came out of it is utterly beautiful . It is possibly the best Disney short , even rivalling The Skeleton Dance . .
544090	562732	130121	5.0	This is even bad for a Hugh Grant movie .	Hugh Grant is widely considered to be one of the more aggravating actors working today . He constantly plays roles which are really only thinly disguised caricatures of the same dainty British guy who has managed to get himself in over his head . Like Woody Allen , his movies are also packed full of little good-naturedly sarcastic one-liners which , ironically , are often the funniest parts of his films . In the James Bond films , the constant barrage of one-liners serve to do little more than remove any scrap of respectability from the films and reduce them to childish excursions full of meaningless sexual innuendos , while in films like Mickey Blue Eyes , these one-liners are quite often genuinely amusing , and some of the better parts of the movie . As the rest of the movie will show , however , having successful one-liners does not by any stretch of the imagination make for a good movie . Grant plays the role of Michael Felgate , an art dealer with a stable career and high hopes of an approaching marriage . He goes through his life happily , running auctions at which he sells obscure paintings for obscene amounts o f money , spending time with his significant other , Gina Vitale ( Jeanne Tripplehorn - I'll get to her later ) , and occasionally dropping amusing wise-cracks . In other words , he's pretty much a regular guy . The introduction of the conflict in the film comes from his efforts to get Gina to agree to marry him . When Michael makes a charming but vain attempt to propose to her through a note inserted into a fortune cookie , Gina freaks out and storms out of the restaurant , telling Michael that she can't , she just can't , leaving him alone in the restaurant and leaving the audience wondering what her intentions had been thus far in the relationship if marriage was so simply out of the question . Besides the botched romance , Tripplehorn delivers an absolutely abysmal performance as the poor poor daughter of the mobster who is just so devastated that she can't marry her true love . She plays the victim well enough , but it's just groan-inducing to watch her make horribly vain attempts to act emotional scenes . Every time she got upset I just wanted to leave the room . The conflict has been thus introduced - Gina can't marry Michael because there are things about her family that he doesn't know about and that she is ashamed to have him discover , which is why she stomped out of the restaurant as though he had admitted cheating on her rather than proposed to her . So after she changes her mind and decides to stay with him just as fast as she rejected him , Michael decides to take it upon himself to get to know her family and thereby resolve any conflict that Gina may have been concerned about . What you have here is a typical formula comedy that unrepentedly feeds off of the stereotypical Italian mafia family , basically stealing the formula from the classic comedies ( namingly The Odd Couple , the formula of which has probably been imitated on a plot level more than any other in cinematic history ) and adding it to the only bad thing about The Godfather , which is the fact that it presented a tremendously stereotypical account of Italians as criminals . Mickey Blue Eyes does nothing new , but rather adds the typical Hugh Grant character to the above borrowed formulas , resulting in a significantly disappointing comedy . The only mildly amusing things in this film are Michael's occasional witty comments , which are punctuated by a series of painfully unamusing scenes - such anything involving the butchering of a foreign accent or a Chinese restaurant owner screaming at Gina to eat fking cookie . It's amazing to me that that ridiculous scene made it into this film . For the most part , they at least got their stereotypical representation of the Italian crime family at least partially right . And by that , of course , I mean that they did a god job stealing the traditional hierarchy of Hollywood's version of Italian crime families , and Mickey Blue Eyes does more than it's part to ensure the world that there are no other types of Italian families than this . As far as the performances , not everything was bad . Jeanne Tripplehorn , as I've already mentioned , immensely over-acted her role , reducing her performance almost to farce , and Hugh Grant was horribly miscast from the outset , but there are some performances in the film that are worth noting . Joe Viterelli , who amazingly manages to look decades younger than he is , is back in basically the exact same role that he played in Analyze This , an immensely superior film . James Caan delivers a performance as Gina's mob father that is just about as fantastic as the material will allow , and more than any other , Burt Young as Vito Graziosi , sort of the head of the family , performs so well in his role that he deserves to be in a far better film . It's too bad that Mickey Blue Eyes turned out to be such a spectacular failure , because it works from a premise that could have made for a much better film . In a way , this movie failed in exactly the same way that Hollow Man did - there were nearly endless possibilities , but they were all ignored in favor of the childish slop that you see in the final cut . We can hope that someday someone will steal the premise of this movie and make that better film , but the unfortunate fact is that this is just not the kind of film that strikes filmmakers as something to borrow from . Ah , well . . .
497048	1355507	171497	4.0	" This guy was ugly before he became a Werewolf . " Cheap horror film .	Lycanthrope starts in a top secret Government laboratory somewhere underground in the middle of the Amazon , a lab where a team of scientists were conducting experiments into the depletion of the o-zone layer & the effects that the suns ultra violet rays have on animal & plant life . Unfortunately something has gone very wrong so the top brass in the American Government send in special forces man Bill Parker ( producer Robert Carradine ) & his sidekick Lee Davis ( Michael Winslow ) to escort Dr . Ivan Stein ( Jeffery Alann Chase ) & his wife Sheila ( Rebecca Holden ) to the lab , assess the situation & ' clean up ' any mess there might be , have you lost the will to live yet ? I had by this point . Some army bird named Rosary ( Dalia Garcia ) & military dude Cody ( Bruce Gregory ) also go along . Once there they discover the various mutilated corpses of the scientific team & some fat black guy wearing an American football shirt who thinks he's a Werewolf because he's been exposed to the suns ultra violet rays . . . Written & directed by Bob Cook who also has a small role in the film as a dead body Lycanthrope is a pretty bad film all round . First it's very clichéd & predictable , for instance the scientists in the team want to study the Werewolf guy while the army dudes just want to kill it . At least a couple of the character's are there merely to pad the film out & become victims , I would also imagine that the pseudo psycho analytic explanation for the Werewolf seemed like a good idea at the time but unfortunately it doesn't translate very well to the screen & it just comes off as completely ridiculous . I suppose the filmmakers wanted to mix the Eco-disaster film with plenty of preaching together with low budget horror , as far as I'm concerned it doesn't work . Having said that the films stuffed with loads of unintentionally hilarious & stupid dialogue , it moves along at a reasonable pace , it's fairly short & it's good for a few laughs . Director Cook was obviously working on a really low budget , the special effects are rubbish including a simple shot of the sun in the sky ! Apparently set in the Amazon it is painfully obvious that it was shot in some local woods , every time the Amazon was mentioned I laughed ! There isn't really a traditional Werewolf in Lycanthrope , only a fat guy who thinks he's one so forget about seeing one . There isn't much gore , only a few after-the-fact dead bodies & a severed hand . Technically Lycanthrope is rough & that's being kind , it's poorly made with very low production values . Now on to the single most interesting aspect of Lycanthrope , have you ever wondered what happened to various stars from the 80's & 90's ? You know who I mean , people like Bill Murray , Steve Guttenberg & Rick Moranis . Well have you ever wondered what happened to the black guy from the Police Academy films who used to make all the funny noises ? Wonder no more as I can reveal he is starring in crap like this ! Yes , in case you want to know he does make lots of funny noises in this as well , talk about type casting ! Unfortunately the budget was so low on Lycanthrope that they couldn't afford him the entire shoot so he was killed off with the first 40 odd minutes . Yep , Lycanthrope really is that low budget ! I bet he & Steve Guttenberg could share some great ' crap films I've been in ' stories during the Police Academy cast union party ! Lycanthrope is a pretty crap film , it's badly made , it's stupid & there aren't any proper Werewolves in it . It's good for a few unintentional laughs & ' that guy from Police Academy ' but otherwise there is very little here to recommend .
571285	4248714	404832	9.0	The British Comedy Awards 2003	As far as I've seen this has always been essential viewing because I am always wanting my favourite comedy shows to be mentioned , nominated or hopefully win . They always have a good host , usually Jonathan Ross to add comedy of his / her own . With the help of clips we see who has been nominated for certain awards and then the special guest giver announces the winner . There are awards such as Best Comedy Show , Comedy Writer , Best Comedy Actor and Actresses and many more . They have some pretty good people to give the awards as well as receive them . Not sure about Johnny Vegas , but they've had Sir Ian McKellen , Peter Kay , Jimmy Carr , Jordan ( Katie Price ) , Richard Curtis , Anthony McPartlin , Declan Donnelly , Lord Richard Attenborough and many others . Very good !
393931	2483625	43959	7.0	Hostages Of A Volatile Bunch Of Outlaws	In the film Rawhide things start out like any other day for Tyrone Power who plays the son of the stage line owner spending some time at one of the way stations learning the business from grizzled old timer Edgar Buchanan . A stage stops by and Susan Hayward and toddler are among the passengers . But when a passing cavalry patrol brings news of a crashout by four very desperate criminals , one of whom was scheduled to be hung the next day , the driver decides he's not taking Sue and the little girl if there's going to be trouble . Even with a cavalry escort which you would think would have been enough to discourage any outlaws from robbing the stage . Sue stays at the station until word of capture or a stage going in another direction arrives . The four outlaws do arrive and they are four really lousy specimens of humanity . Led by Hugh Marlowe the candidate for the rope , the others include Jack Elam , George Tobias , and Dean Jagger . They kill Buchanan and stay at the station hoping to holdup a stage carrying a gold shipment . Marlowe is light years away from the nice guy playwright in All About Eve . You can hardly believe this is the same actor . But the guy making his first real mark in the cinema is Jack Elam . One of the most psychotic villains ever put on screen , Elam makes full use of his blind eye for some incredible facial expressions . His unconcealed lust for Hayward is driving Marlowe to his wits end who needs Power alive at least until the robbery is done . Tyrone Power was 37 when he made Rawhide , a bit too old for the part he was playing , still he does a good job . This is a remake of an earlier 20th Century Fox film Show Them No Mercy which had a modern setting and the Power and Hayward roles were played by Rochelle Hudson and Edward Norris who were barely in their twenties . But it's the outlaws here who really make this film . As Marlowe is quick to comment this isn't a crew he'd pick , they just happened to be around when he made his break and they went along for the ride . Tobias and Jagger play a pair of amiable duds , Marlowe is bitter and angry , but Elam is psychotic . Henry Hathaway got good performances in this suspense filled western . Of the outlaws the idiot Jagger in the end has the most sense . See the film to know what I'm talking about .

Peter Weller ( RoboCop ) didn't have Nacy Allen around to help him , so he relied on Jennifer Rubin ( Roger Corman's Wasp Woman ) . They made a nice pair , but he still cut her hand to check if she bled . She kissed him after that . What a woman will do when there are no other men around ! Lots of shooting at these screaming robots , but not much else .
417546	663392	74937	10.0	Classic Comedy Film	Over the years I missed this film and really appreciated viewing great actors from the past and present who were able to perform Drama as well as , COMEDY . The story starts out with all the famous Hollywood detectives from the past namely , Charlie Chan , Nick & Nora Charles etc . , who were all called different names in this picture . They are invited to a dinner where a murder is going to be witnessed and of course there will be clues to the guilt person or persons . Eileen Brennan , ( Tess Skeffington ) , was a partner to Peter Falk and was very young looking in 1976 , she was the Sgt . in " Private Benjamin " , and gave a great performance in this film as a tipsy blonde gal . Truman Capote , ( Lionel Twain ) , " In Cold Blood " , made an appearance but his acting was horrible , but funny , considering he is an author and not in the acting field . This is a great film to view and enjoy , even if you have not seen it in a long time . Nancy Walker was a maid and did a great job of saying not a WORD !
487574	386241	91575	5.0	OK if predictable .	An OK if relentlessly , thoroughly predictable Bronson thriller , certainly better than a " Death Wish " sequel . Some amusing profanities stand out and almost save the very boring script . Thomson's direction is routine .
447989	1048771	59793	6.0	One of the better Disney family comedies from the ' 60s . . .	The Siamese cat not only has the title role , he steals the film ! The silly plot involves a couple of bumbling bank robbers ( FRANK GORSHIN is one of them ) , who kidnap a woman from the bank who's able to signal for help by putting her wrist watch around the cat's neck . The cat belongs to HAYLEY MILLS , who picks up on the signal and then must convince the FBI to help her ( and her cat ) find the robbers in time to save the woman . DEAN JONES is the earnest but bumbling FBI man who decides to help Hayley . All of the incidents surrounding the cat are deftly handled with a great deal of humor . ELSA LANCHESTER and WILLIAM DEMAREST are funny as snooping neighbors and RODDY McDOWALL and ED WYNN have some good moments too . But it's HAYLEY MILLS at her most appealing and " that darn cat " that really steal the show . The cat " DC " is simply amazingly natural and perhaps the most convincing member of the cast . Summing up : One of the better Disney comedies during the ' 60s .
479455	463200	338526	6.0	Not the disaster I heard it was - - but not good at all	In the 18th century , Gabriel Van Helsing ( Hugh Jackman ) who is working for the church ( ? ? ? ) travels to Romania with a monk Carl ( David Wenham ) to battle Dracula ( Richard Roxburgh ) , his three brides , the Wolf Man ( Will Kemp ) and the Frankenstein Monster ( Shuler Hensley ) . He's helped by feisty Anna Valerious ( Kate Beckinsale ) . This has been trashed by critics everywhere . No it isn't good at all . . . but I've seen worse . It starts off great with a black & white prologue dealing with Dr . Frankenstein creating the Monster for Dracula . The doctor is killed and so is his creation ( supposedly ) . Then it cuts to a year later with Van Helsing being sent to battle Dracula and his three wives who are attacking a nearby village for blood . There he finds a werewolf roaming about also and the Monster is alive . But Dracula wants the monster to . . . . FORGET IT ! The plot just gets more vague and sillier as it goes on . Anyways plot is not the reason this movie exists - - it's done to push CGI down our throats . There's LOTS of action in this film , incredible special effects ( all are CGI ) and tons of explosions and such - - - but I was bored . The plot is WAY too vague and the dialogue is on the level of an Archie comic book . There's no characterizations or depth to ANY of the characters - - how was I supposed to care for these people when I didn't know who they were ? Also this film has way too much going on it in - - the opening has Van Helsing killing Mr . Hyde ( and Dr . Jekyll too ) ! And pitting him against THREE monsters was just overkill . Jackman was very good ( considering he had nothing to do ) . Beckinsale was terrible but it's not her fault . Wenham unfortunately plays the " comic " relief ( and is hating every second of it ) . Kemp has little screen time but he is good ( and VERY handsome ) . Hensley is good as Frankenstein's monster . The makeup on the vampires and werewolves was VERY impressive too . And there was a great fight between two monsters at the end . But it's all money and CGI and no plot or characters . It's also frustrating that the violence was really toned down for the PG-13 - - there's next to no blood or gore in this film . And it's TOO LONG - - an elaborate masquerade party could have been left out completely ( and is a total ripoff of Roman Polanski's " The Fearless Vampire Killers " ) . This was a bomb at the box office so we're ( thankfully ) not going to get any sequels . I can't recommend it - - but kids will like it .
462990	2467618	313	7.0	A very rough gem that MAY be original , . . . I hope	The same night I watched this silent short , I also saw a French film called " Rêve et réalité " ( 1901 ) . It turns out the French movie was a knockoff of this film - - with the exact same plot and scenes ! While it was common for many of the very early studios to plagiarize each other's work , this one is one of the more flagrant examples . I just hope that LET ME DREAM AGAIN is the actual first film of its kind and not a rip-off of another , earlier film ! The story is immensely simple ( as was true of nearly all films from this era ) . An old guy is making out with a pretty young lady and life seems grand - - until he wakes up and realizes it's all a dream ! The idea is cute , though the execution is a tad primitive and rough . Still , given its tremendous age , it's still pretty watchable today .
427123	3079504	66221	5.0	Legendary road accident of a film is interesting in the " I can't believe this was actually made " sort of way	Odds are you have never seen The Phynx and for good reason . This is the deformed beast of a child that Hollywood wants to keep locked up in the attic . Its the hell-spawn of the youth movement and the old embalmed generation coming together to make . . . something . The basic plot concerns the SSA ( Super Secret Agency ) attempting to rescue the icons of American culture that have been kidnapped and brought to Albania . Who are the great icons ? George Jessel , Rudy Vallee , Edgar Bergan , Huntz Hall , Leo Gorcey , Joe Louis , Col . Sanders , Xavier Cugat and probably a dozen others ( all I can say is I hope they were paid a lot ) . SSA decides that the best way to get them out is top form a rock band ( think Monkees and Beatles singing songs by Lieber and Stoller ) and have them invited into the country . They then kidnap Two white guys an Indian and a black guy and force them to be spies and a rock group thus allowing for some surreal bits as other stars show up to train the band ( Richard Pryor , Dick Clark , James Brown among others ) . My jaw dropped and stayed down for a good portion of the films running time . I'm not sure how to rate this film . Its occasionally funny , has some good songs and proves that not everyone needs drugs to have their brain smashed like an egg . This is a clear warning about who and who should not be mating . Clearly its a movie that wants to appeal to the youth market while at the same time doing everything it can to attack and make fun of the same market . Its as if your stuffed shirt of an uncle made your choices in current popular culture , clearly you wouldn't want to see his choices . At the same time the film is clearly about youth and what was then current culture so it wouldn't appeal to the old folks . Its a movie that will appeal to no one . Actually not no one , bad movie lovers , fans of surrealism , those who must see every movie made by their favorite star , masochists , mental patients and those who want a unique ( but not necessarily good ) viewing experience will want to check the film out . I've given it a because there is some good and some bad mixed in with the " I don't believe this " material so its the fairest rating I could come up with . Your reaction will be your own and with a movie like this I don't even want to guess what that is going to be . Take this review as either and invitation or a warning , its your choice .

Prue and Phoebe follow the girl and the trio is sucked by a vortex inside the van . They find a playground in the middle of the snow and several children hiding from The Nothing . They rescue the children and once back in San Francisco , they realize that they are demon children . Meanwhile , their father Victor Bennett returns and helps his daughters to fix the situation , capturing the dangerous demons and sending them back to The Nothing .

In a conquest to save the world , Clouseau heads out to put an end to Dreyfus's terror once and for all . . . . a great entry into the series and it still feels as fresh and as funny , as when i first saw it a long time ago . it's not big , it's not clever , it's just full of silly jokes that you can see coming a mile off . but this makes it all the more funny . Sellers is fantastic as Clouseau and really knows his physical comedy . some of the set pieces are hilarious , such as the Oktoberfest scene where all the assassins are after Clouseau and kill each other . not a film to be taken seriously at all , but laugh out loud all the way .
513517	3223254	1085496	4.0	Nice Sea Oats , Clover , Ocean Rocks , but . . .	ROCK HAVEN seems to have its heart in the right place , showing the conflict between the religious right and human sexuality that occurs between two young teenagers , but the script is minimal , uncomfortable in saying what it really wants to say , and in the end the resulting film is a long drawn out series of a few sentences followed by lengthy views of the ocean and the wild flowers at coastline ( even though Bodega Bay is stunningly beautiful to watch ! ) . Brady ( Sean Hoagland ) lives at the beach with his mother ( Laura Jane Coles ) preparing to go to Bible college at summer's end : the two are strongly right wing religious people . Into this rather rigid atmosphere steps Clifford ( Owen Alabado ) and there is an immediate chemistry between the two young lads - Clifford being openly gay while Brady is so far back in the dark closet that Clifford's mere presence terrifies him . Clifford's mother ( Katheryn Hecht ) is a free spirit who deals comfortably with her son's feelings and tries to support Brady in his fear of sinning . Brady's mother ' can't change the way she believes ' ( gay relationships are sinful ) and tries to ' change ' Brady by encouraging his attraction to a sweet well-meaning girl ( Erin Daly ) who just happens to understand Brady's needs more than he does ! The manner in which this conflict is approached and quasi-resolved is weak as written and directed by David Lewis ( who also plays the role of the minister . . . ) , and the ending is unsatisfactory at best . The quality of acting is low on the scale but the sincerity is palpable . The viewer wants to care for these young lads confronting love for the first time , but the situation posed by the meager dialog and the ending keep it from becoming the nice little wisp of a film it could have been . The scenery is the star , but it is hardly the ' haven ' for this dilemma that the title suggests . Grady Harp
576361	1399158	39748	7.0	RAILROADED ! ( Anthony Mann , 1947 )	This is another fine Mann noir ? though I'd personally rank it lower than , say , RAW DEAL ( 1948 ) or SIDE STREET ( 1950 ) . On the debit side are the weak male leads ? Hugh Beaumont as the cop ( though he's better here than in BURY ME DEAD [ 1947 ] ) and Ed Kelly as the framed boy ? and the somewhat familiar storyline . On the other hand , John Ireland ( surprisingly top-billed ) is impressive as the heavy and Jane Randolph ( hair dyed blonde ) makes for an interesting femme fatale ? but , just as striking , is lovely Sheila Ryan playing the spunky if naïve leading lady . As befits the genre ? in which Mann excelled , before changing course eventually with the psychological Western ? the film is at its best when relying on shadowy lighting to create mood or highlight moments of suspense , menace and outbursts of violence ( notably the final showdown between Beaumont and Ireland in a darkened bar-room ) . The film is available on an old and expensive bare-bones DVD from Kino , from which the DivX copy I watched was culled .
370101	2488512	78916	6.0	Sick , Twisted and Kinky	When the wealthy orphan taxidermist Frank Wyler ( Kieran Canter ) loses his beloved fiancée Anna Völkl ( Cinzia Monreale ) , victim of voodoo conducted by his jealous housemaid Iris ( Franca Stoppi ) , he robs her corpse , embalms and brings to the bed in his room . He does not overcome his feelings for her , killing every woman he has some involvement . Meanwhile Iris wants to marry Frank and helps him to dispose the bodies . The sick , twisted and kinky " Buio Omega " has all sort of perversions and disgusting scenes , with sequences of necrophilia , mutilation , torture and embalming . However , the characters are awfully developed , and the viewer never knows , for example , whether Frank changed his behavior after the death of Anna , or he was indeed a twisted character . The weird Iris is also badly developed . The graphic and gore scenes are among the nastiest I have ever seen in a film . Title ( Brazil ) : Not Available
574517	4532636	27969	7.0	Harold Lloyd , Middle-Weight Boxing Champ of the World	In this very solid Harold Lloyd screwball comedy , Lloyd plays an unassuming milk delivery man who finds himself on the front pages when he's credited with knocking out the world middle-weight boxing champion , Speed McFarland , in a street brawl . The negative publicity this news generates for McFarland comes much to the dismay of McFarland's manager , the slick Adolphe Menjou , who instantly plans a damage-control scheme . Lloyd will go up against a number of other boxers and win in fixed fights , building anticipation for a rematch against McFarland , in which McFarland will clobber him in the first round , since Lloyd doesn't really know how to fight . Of course , nothing plays out as simply as it should , and all manner of hijinks and supporting characters find themselves mixed up in this zany plot . I was impressed by the tight screenplay for " The Milky Way . " It's classic 30s screwball , which means the script doesn't have to make a lot of sense , but even so the scriptwriters flesh out little details in the action - - like a thug who can't read , or Lloyd's affection for his milk cart horse , Agnes - - that play a role later in the plot . And the film is filled with all manner of sight gags and one-liners . Some of my favorite set pieces are the ones in which Menjou's sardonic girlfriend , played like a champ by Verree Teasdale , an actress I've never heard of , teaches Lloyd how to box by turning his training into a dance lesson ; and a hilarious bit that finds Lloyd racing to his big match with McFarland while lugging around a colt , offspring of the beloved Agnes . Director Leo McCarey knows how to stage physical comedy , and the frame at any given time is stuffed with all manner of characters doing or saying something completely separate from what everybody else is doing or saying , so that the reigning visual style of the film is controlled chaos . " The Milky Way " may not be in the same league as some of its screwball contemporaries , like " My Man Godfrey " or " Bringing Up Baby , " but I guarantee it will put a smile on your face .
492752	3280905	550294	9.0	Chief Inspector Jowett's big moment in the " Cribb " Series	David Waller was a familiar face in British television and movies in his career - never a big name character actor but a dependable one . His best recalled performance ( to me ) was as that master politician Stanley Baldwin ( in EDWARD AND MRS . SIMPSON ) forced to manipulate a foolish monarch off the throne ( he does so quite adroitly , but he does regret the necessity of it ) . But usually Waller played " Col . Blimp " types - conservative , authority figures who slow down or put up road blocks to the plans of other characters in the story lines . He was given the role , in the " Sgt . Cribb " series , of Chief Inspector Jowett , Cribb's supervisor . Except for the episode A CASE OF SPIRITS ( where Thorley Walters played Jowett ) Waller kept the role in the entire series . In the series he was more than just the man who gave Cribb his assignments . Cribb's tragedy ( if you follow the novels ) is that he is a very sharp man , but he is lower class - he is not likely to ever get into an Inspector's job , even if he deserves it . Jowett is upper class , and he has gotten into a Chief Inspector's job . He is not brilliant ( he needs Cribb for that ) but he is careful and observes the statutory law - and he has the fine understanding of the social order to know just what is expected to be covered up if anything has to be . The reason Jowett has gotten as far as he did is that he's honest . In 1877 the Detective Branch at Scotland Yard was badly shaken by a bribery scandal that officially ended with three Detectives ( two of them Chief Inspectors ) going to prison , and the head of the department having to retire even though the jury found he did nothing technically illegal . The exact extent of the bribery scandal is still unknown ( it is suspected that many others were bribed over the years , but only the four on trial were caught ) . Jowett never took a bribe , so he was promoted to Chief Inspector . Usually Jowett appeared in the background of the stories ( exception was A CASE OF SPIRITS , where he was one of the believers in paranormal phenomenon ) . But in MURDER OLD BOY ? he is brought forward into the plot ( like Thackeray was in THE HORIZONTAL WITNESS ) . Jowett is sent an invitation to a reunion of his public school class . This by itself is nothing , but Jowett is disturbed by the person who sent the invitation : a man named Russell Haygarth ( John Carson ) , who has had a checkered career to say the least . So Jowett asks Cribb and Thackeray to go to the local village and check into the inn there , and do some outside inquiries while he attends the reunion . It is a smallish reunion . Only three other men from the Public School Class attend : a doctor ( boasting of his surgical standing ) , an actor ( who is constantly suggesting that Sir Henry Irving , Richard Mansfield , and William Terriss are taking tips from him about performances ) , and a solicitor . The doctor used to bully Jowett , and seems prepared to resume this . As for the school , it has had better days . The headmaster is a young man ( Terence Edmond ) and there is a house matron ( Petra Davies ) but little evidence of any fresh students . In fact , the reunion is ( suspiciously ) occurring during a holiday week - when no students would be there to be seen . The bulk of the episode finds Jowett recalling the less pleasant aspects of being a public school boy , due to the bullying of the surgeon . He also does demonstrate that while not Cribb's equal as a detective in finding clues he is sharp in his own way ( his suspicions about Haygarth are proved right ) . Cribb also finds out that Jowett's three fellow alumni have things to hide as well , and that the school is on it's last legs ( Thackeray actually is shocked that Jowett is connected to such a second-rate public school ) . The crisis comes after Haygarth makes a pitch for funds to save the school . Shortly afterward he is found murdered . The conclusion is one of the better ones in the series , especially for those episodes written for the series . And Jowett is last seen , after the others have left , enjoying the remaining days of his vacation with the school matron .

514987	317399	924129	7.0	A Nutshell Review : Crossing Over	Like Crash , Fast Food Nation and Babel before it , Crossing Over consists of multiple story lines bound together by a common theme examined , sometimes with just a few characters straddling across the narrative threads to link them up explicitly . Writer-director Wayne Kramer examines the issues behind the illegal immigrant problem in USA who are either trying to lay low in avoiding the law , or trying their best to gain legal residency with each experiencing different challenges that lie ahead in their quest . And it's quite ambitious for Kramer to try and pull off no less than seven parallel threads in the film , which to a certain extent I felt was largely successful , despite some being almost peripheral if not for the presence of a recognized star . Anchored by Harrison Ford as Max Brogan , an Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) agent , the film weaves in and out of the different threads without feeling too forced , or the need for some compulsory and carefully designed moments to link the stories up intricately . Sometimes like the six degrees of separation , the film captures the fact that we don't have full details of that web of links , and it will feel very artificial if everyone knew everyone else , or if one event would impact severely on another . In any case , each of the story lines were engaging enough , some employing deep emotions to argue their case , while others even had to build to a crescendo of all out action , such as a supermarket shootout ( one of the nicely executed ones I've seen ) . There's an illegal Mexican woman ( a very short role by Alice Braga ) who begs Ford's Max to look after her young son in the care of unfriendly relatives , a Jewish musician ( Jim Sturgess ) who's waiting to qualify for residency and willing to do just anything to get there , his Australian girlfriend ( Alice Eve ) and Hollywood actress wannabe who had granted 2 months worth of on-demand sexual favours to an Immigration official ( Ray Liotta ) in exchange for a green card , whose wife ( Ashley Judd ) wants to adopt a child placed in a detention centre , who meets an Iranian girl ( Summer Bishil whose essay failed to condemn the terrorists of and gotten her and her family into hot soup . Then there's a Korean family who is waiting to be naturalized whose eldest son got involved with thugs ( ala Gran Torino rites of passage style ) , and another ICE agent ( Cliff Curtis ) whose family cannot stand their estranged sister whom they feel is a disgrace of their values , tradition and custom by adopting the lifestyle of Americans , yet strangely ironic as they too pursue to be American citizens . Phew , and all this with a little murder mystery thrown into the mix as well . It's about how one aspires to live in a country , yet uncompromising in one's position to adopt and adapt to the new environment . Which brings about some xenophobia , especially if one's too different from the rest , and things are made worst with the citizens unwilling to understand and lend assistance in assimilation to a new country and its idiosyncrasies . But what seemed to be a common theme here , is how power can be either used to do what's probably morally right , versus abusing it for personal gain . Given three of the lead characters here are law enforcement or in responsible positions in government agencies , it's easy to abuse privilege , and it's nothing new too , even in local context , where sexual favours get traded for leniency or the closing of an eye pertaining to illegal workers , or those here without the proper papers . And since the law is fixed ( and sometimes perverse by those who interpret it ) , and justice blind , I suppose there are times we may be compelled to lend a hand to a stranger out of nothing but on humanitarian grounds , in doing what's right and decent for a fellow human being . Crossing Over presents many of such situations and while it may be a mixed bag in its narrative , it certainly pushes the right buttons with its star-studded ensemble cast in making the audience think about , empathize with , and examine if the issues presented could have existed in the local context , with similar challenges in the treatment of those who are illegal immigrants .
508921	453068	64647	6.0	make sure to find it with subtitles	Currently there is a version of Measures Against Fanatics on you-tube , which was how I got to see this short Werner Herzog film from early in his career . It's about horse racing , or rather the people who take care of the horses , and how to , apparently , protect them from the ' fanatics ' of the title . Unfortunately , it's hard to really give a totally quantifiable rating to the documentary , because the version currently available , despite being in excellent picture and sound quality , has no subtitles in English ( and being that I'm not up on my German much at all I could only pick out a few words here and there based on what I've heard in other movies and elsewhere ) . As far as visuals go it's not bad , though there's not a whole lot Herzog can go in photographing such things like horses walking around and their protectors talking ( though it is cool to see one of the horses walking around ) . It seems to mostly be dull even without knowing entirely what the context is usually in , but there are still some noticeable Herzogian moments , like when the one trainer or whomever proceeds to break blocks of wood with his hand . Or with the mere presence of the old man , who always seems to be interrupting the dialog the person answering is having , always with his say . The music is also ironically cheerful , which makes funny in an off-kilter sort of way . It is worth watching , if you're a Herzog fan like I am , though knowing a little German might help add a little extra enjoyment .

Dolph Lundgren plays the role in this incarnation and is much more imposing , with better physical presence . this is mainly due to his size . he definitely would inspire fear in the criminal element . Lundgren is not really a great actor , but he doesn't need to be for this role . overall , this a good movie , more subdued than the 2004 version . there is more physical action , but very little of things blowing up , which works in this film's favor . a strong
442791	819382	758757	6.0	Challenging Adult Story of American Terrorists	A lot of reviewers seemed to despise this inexpensive but thoughtful movie . The fons et origo of their hatred ( because that's what it is ) is the spouting of anti-government notions by the three or four terrorists to which the movie introduces us . It's probably a good idea to keep in mind that the description of events on the screen doesn't mean that the writers or the director endorses those events . Otherwise the guys who write and direct stupid slasher movies are all in a world of difficulty . It's also probably the case that the calumny heaped upon the execution of the film - - " boring , " " too long , " " no action " , " leftist propaganda " , and so on - - stems from the reviewers ' dislike of the fact that the terrorists are given an extensive hearing without any too-obvious condemnation of what they're saying . Not that it's a perfect movie by any means . The four terrorists - - well , three , really , since one of them is an FBI infiltrator or something - - are John Shea , Henry Simmons , and Juliet Marquis , and they all do the jobs of seasoned professionals . Shea is the intellectual of the group , the guy who provides the justification for building the bomb . Simmons is an embittered and impotent Gulf War veteran . Juliet Marquis , who is beautiful without being in the least Hollywood-pretty , is the sexual glue that hold the others together . Michael Mosely is the innocent , wide-eyed , somewhat skeptical young man who is recruited by accident into the group and becomes an informant . Shea's reasoning never really makes much sense . He sees evidence of a conspiracy by the Project For a New American Century everywhere , helped by those at the top who would destroy our liberties , our way of life . The choice of , for instance , as the day of attacks was not chosen at random . The hijackers knew that there would be an Air Force drill that day that would confuse radar operators and air controllers with lots of false positives . How did they know ? Somebody in the Pentagon must have told them , using Osama bin Laden as the conduit . You know , if you throw a handful of pebbles on the floor they will scatter and form a random pattern . But if you look closely enough , and if your desire to find a pattern is strong enough , you can connect the dots and find an elephant parade or whatever it is you're searching for . What you're looking for depends on your beliefs about the world you live in . That's why the Chinese zodiac is different from ours , although both zodiacs are socially constructed from random arrays . The three wing nuts we see in this movie aren't stupid by any means . Shea is a successful historian and author . It's just that the pattern he builds out of random events don't jibe with the pattern the rest of us see . However , he's articulate in explaining why he thinks the way he does , and that must be what's irritating some of the other reviewers . They'd likely prefer Shea to be a gibbering maniac of the sort we see in so many childish action films . A joke instead of a human being . I wish , though , that the damned movie had been built in a more linear way instead of jumping back and forth in time so often . It's all talk and it gets confusing after a while . And the motives behind the planned bombing aren't made at all clear . The motives behind the individuals involved are either formulaic ( the black guy who is impotent ) or unexplained ( Shea's intellectualism ) . And I'm not sure why , in the last shot , the informer drops the pistol's hammer on an empty chamber while aiming at his boss's forehead . In the end , I don't like having my nose rubbed in obvious propaganda either . That's why I don't generally like Costa-Gavras's work . But if this film is propaganda , I don't know which point of view is being peddled . Certainly not the domestic terrorists . For all their devotion and self-righteousness , I never felt for a moment that the writer / director was rooting for them to actually do it and get away with it , nor that he was urging the audience to root for them .
484537	1416505	462504	7.0	Good movie but weak in its most crucial moments .	This is definitely a very professionally made movie with also some great acting but the movie falls short with its most crucial and emotional moments and also ends on a very false note . It's also made fairly obviously throughout this movie that it had a fairly low budget . Some of the special effects are simply below par by todays standards and the plane crash itself is also done quite laughable to be honest , clearly because they didn't had the right resources and money to do it any better . Bet most of the money went into the fact that his movie was shot in location in Thailand . Accordingly , the movie had a $10 , 000 , 000 budget , so no wonder the movie looked the way it did . But I have to admit that the movie is definitely better looking then its budget might indicate . Werner Herzog shows he's a capable director , who can work around things . The story on its own is quite good and intriguing , also not in the least because its based on a true story , though the movie obviously takes lots of liberties with it . The movie has some good and effective psychological elements such as the question to escape or not to escape . The movie does a good job at getting you in the minds of the prisoners and be able to understand each of their motivations . But as far as POW movies go , the movie doesn't really provide anything new or shocking . The movie touches all fairly familiar grounds and perhaps doesn't do a good enough job creating a tense and dangerous atmosphere of a POW camp . Or perhaps this is also because of the reason that you just KNOW in advance that at least the main character escapes and survives , since this movie got based on his story . The ending should had been way more smaller and personal , to make it also more emotional and therefore powerful and effective . It now instead has a big , totally unbelievable and overblown typical Hollywood ending . I don't know what it is with German directors but their are often more patriotic and overblown when it comes down to Hollywood and American elements , then most American directors . For example also see Roland Emmerich , who made movies such as " Independence Day " and " The Patriot " . Perhaps its the cast , next to its professional directing , that make the movie still work out as a good one . Christian Bale is great as always ( when will he get his Oscar ? ) , in a role for which he once more lost a significant amount of weight . Same goes for the other actors portraying the prisoners , such as Steve Zahn and Jeremy Davies . Also especially is really great in his role . He has a great , distinctive and very recognizable way of acting . It's a real good movie but really , is it worthy of all that praise and high rating on here ? Really a bit too much credit all .
437775	306861	23948	10.0	An All-Star Classic	A flamboyant old actress with memories of lovers long dead . An alcoholic actor desperate for one more chance on the stage . An Oklahoma tycoon and his below-the-tracks , tough as nails wife . A philandering doctor and his faithful wife . They're all invited to meet tonight at the mansion home of a dying industrialist and his flighty , society-obsessed wife for DINNER AT EIGHT . Following the great success of GRAND HOTEL in 1932 , MGM & producer David O . Selznick embarked on producing an even greater all-star triumph . They succeeded . DINNER AT EIGHT takes a first class list of performers at the top of their form ( Marie Dressler , John Barrymore , Lionel Barrymore , Wallace Beery , Jean Harlow , Billie Burke ) and seamlessly , if a bit implausibly , weaves a plot full of comedy & tragedy which allows each star to strut their stuff . Dressler was Hollywood's top star at this time and she is wonderful , fingering her jewelry - each piece a remembrance of an ancient romance . She has only one scene with gorgeous Harlow and that comes at the very end of the film , but it's a classic . The rest of the cast is a wonderful grab bag of talent : peppery Lee Tracy , elderly Louise Closser Hale , gentle Jean Hersholt , as well as Phillips Holmes , Edmund Lowe , Karen Morley , Madge Evans , Grant Mitchell , Elizabeth Patterson , May Robson , Herman Bing . Take a moment to consider Edward Woods , playing Eddie the bell boy . The year before at Warner Brothers he had traded roles with James Cagney in a little picture called PUBLIC ENEMY . Cagney became an instant , huge celebrity . Woods continued to play bell boy roles . . .
430682	1173088	56801	10.0	Fellini's visionary , autobiographical masterpiece	" 8 " is an extraordinary , visionary masterpiece from Fellini , and one of his best films . After browsing through the IMDb forums for the movie , it seems many people are upset about its low ranking on the site's " Top 250 " - one fan noting it has dropped below " Pirates of the Caribbean . " But does it really matter where it stands on a list that includes movies like " Lord of the Rings " in the top five ? " 8 " concerns itself with a film director named Guido who has what Fellini described as " director's block " - he can't film anything . Stressed and pressured , Guido begins to retreat into his dreams and memories of passed relationships and experiences . This movie is mind-boggling from beginning to end - its opening in particular is classic , with Guido's dream , and the man in the car floating into the heavens and then falling into water . This movie has inspired many great directors of today ( most noticeably Terry Gilliam , who has an introduction on the wonderful Criterion Collection DVD ) and it would be a crime if you're a film buff and decide to pass on this .
483108	1293485	86066	6.0	" We're doing it for Johnny ! "	I just watched once again " I love the 80's : Strikes Back " and they mentioned in ' 83 The Outsiders , I've been putting off this movie for quite a while , considering how many stars are in this film , I kept on trying to remind myself to rent it , I finally remembered ! This film in a nutshell is West Side Story without the love story , the singing , or the dancing , so in some ways if you got scarred of that , you needn't worry any more . This is an incredible cast that you would never imagine at the time would make it so far in life , like Matt Dillion , Tom Cruise , Emilio Estovez , Rob Lowe , Patrick Swaze , etc . They play " The Outsiders " , just the rebels of the town , but trouble ensues when the preps attack them and in defense one of them accidentally kills one of the preps and a huge rival happens . Over all , I'd say that it's a decent flick , it's a bit dated , but it's very intense and I'd say actually a good movie to watch . It set a bar for these actors and they might not be where they are today , they had some pretty great performances . I do love that line " We're doing it for Johnny ! " . : ) So , go ahead and grab the popcorn for this one !

The Passion of Jesus Christ ' 04	Have not viewed " Ben Hur " since it first came out in 1959 , and was thrilled by the great acting of Charlton Heston , ( Judah Ben-Hur ) , " Any Given Sunday " , ' 99 . Heston , portrayed a Jewish man beaten down by the Roman's and even his best friend turned against him and he was a slave on a ship , rowing himself to death . This film was a Hollywood production , but it showed the great Passion of Jesus Christ in different ways that all the family could enjoy , both YOUNG and OLD , were able to view this picture without any : - SHOCK FACTORS ! You could actually see Jesus carrying his CROSS and also hanging on the CROSS which was graphic enough for me ! Sam Jaffe , ( Simonides ) , " Ben Casey " , ' 61 tv series , gave an outstanding supporting role to this picture along with Stephen Boyd ( Messala ) , " Kill " , ' 72 , who passed away early in life and Martha Scott ( Miriam ) , " Sayonara " , ' 57 . Future pictures like this one should be created with more details given to the Life Of Jesus and his great healing powers and the great influence He had while he was living briefly on this earth !

576740	1399158	82159	2.0	Charlie Chan And The Curse Of The Dragon Queen ( Clive Donner , 1981 )	Abysmal would-be spoof of the well-loved series of films featuring the Oriental detective , possibly made in the wake of ( and a very long way from ) the runaway box-office success of Neil Simon's MURDER BY DEATH ( 1976 ) . The few bright moments provided by Chan's old flame Lee Grant and befuddled cop Brian Keith are completely sunk by the fatal miscasting of Peter Ustinov ( who is truly terrible here and should have stuck to portraying Hercule Poirot ) , the painfully unfunny antics of his accident-prone son Richard Hatch and the absurd histrionics of Grant's faithful maid Rachel Roberts . The cast also features Angie Dickinson ( underused as the Dragon Queen of the title ) , Roddy McDowall ( as a wheelchair-bound and vaguely sinister butler ) , Michelle Pfeiffer as Hatch's fiancée and Johnny Sekka . Ironically , the film's story writer / producer Jerry Sherlock currently runs the Hollywood branch of The New York Film Academy ; thankfully , I hadn't watched this mess before I embarked on their eight-week film-making program late last year ! Besides , I suppose the fact that director Clive Donner had previously helmed the uncontrollable WHAT'S NEW PUSSYCAT ? ( 1965 ) should have been fair warning against this one . . .

406060	2020269	110005	9.0	The absolute opposite of Bad Taste !	Despite being a huge fan of Peter Jackson's splatter-classics " Bad Taste " and " Braindead " , this ultra-stylish and distinguished period drama felt like a welcome surprise and it more than clearly indicated how Jackson is an extremely versatile filmmaker , rather than just a sick puppy with an unhealthy interest in severed body parts . " Heavenly Creatures " is ( very truthfully ) based on a notorious real-life murder that took place in New Zealand during the 1950's . Two teenage schoolgirls , whose intimate friendship quickly got rejected by all the adults surrounding them , brutally killed the mother of one of them . Rather than purely building up towards this ultimately grisly and disturbing murder , Peter Jackson surprisingly dedicates a lot of time and effort into re-enacting the close friendship between Juliet ( a clever and eloquent English immigrant ) and Pauline ( an introvert and docile local working-class daughter ) . From their first encounters in the schoolyard , over their development of common tastes in movies & music , to the eventual fleeing into their own utopia-world known as the Fourth World . Kate Winslet ? in her debut ? is amazing as the headstrong Juliet , who drags Pauline along in her fascination for crooner Mario Lanza and eerie actor Orson Welles until both girls become dangerously inseparable . When the parents then begin to worry about their daughters ' wayward and peculiar behavior , the girls bring out their daydreaming to the real world , with very deadly results . " Heavenly Creatures " is a very powerful film ! In case you still have any doubts regarding the subject , it's not just the story of two lesbians versus the rest of the world , but a truly gripping & tasteful drama that masterfully captures the prudish life-styles of the 1950's and puts genuine acting talents into the spotlights . The end sequence is harrowing and very unsettling . Jackson's previous films " Bad Taste " and especially " Braindead " all together featured approximately 500 gory massacres , yet not one of them felt as painful & intense as the sole murder in " Heavenly Creatures " . Excellent movie with great acting , great atmospheric tension and dazzling music . Highly recommended to all the true fans of cinema .
571720	4248714	95489	6.0	The Land Before Time	When I was young I used to love this prehistoric cartoon from the makers of An American Tail , and director Don Bluth . A brontosaurus ( or Long Neck ) named Littlefoot is orphaned after Sharp Tooth the Tyranosaurus Rex kills his mother . He travels with a bunch of friends also separated from their parents ( by an earthquake ) to a place called The Great Valley . He travels with Three Horn ( Tricerotops ) , Cera , Big Mouth ( ? ) , Ducky , Flyer ( Terodactal ) , Petrie and Spike Tail ( ? ) , Spike . As they travel they are both trying to escape from Sharp Tooth , and trying to get tree stars ( leaves ) to eat from trees . The kids will love both the good animation , and the fact that the main characters are dinosaurs . I would also recommend this to parents with very young kids who were frightened by Steven Spielberg's Jurassic Park . Narrated by Batman's Pat Hingle . Good !
419570	1609079	202208	5.0	. . . but only 30 cents ' worth of sense .	Several things about this movie " $30 , 000 " intrigued me very much , not least its unusual title . This is a haunted-house film . When I mentioned a haunted house , you likely envisioned a creaky old mansion . There's another thing that intrigued me : the haunted house in ' $30 , 000 ' is a brand-new block of flats , not a creaky mansion . What creaks here is the plot's pay-off . Spalding Nelson ( handsome JW Kerrigan ) is a resourceful young man whose widowed aunt Mrs Bradford ( Myrtle Rischell ) and her two daughters Barbara ( Fritzi Brunette ; wotta name ! ) and Clare ( Margery Wilson ) recently moved into a new block of flats . The aunt is distressed because the building seems to be haunted ; she and other tenants keep hearing whispers , footsteps , stifled screams . This is a brilliant premise . . . for a SOUND movie , not a silent . The grammar of silent film requires that , when the characters on screen hear a sudden noise , we the audience must see an insert shot of a hand rapping a door knocker ( or whatever ) so we know the sound's source . That rule can be broken once or twice in a silent movie , but not repeatedly . Throughout ' $30 , 000 ' , Kerrigan and other cast members keep reacting to sounds WE can't hear , so we expect to be SHOWN them . . . but they can't be shown , because to do so would give away the mystery . Spalding is on the ball , and he takes temporary lodging in his aunt's flat so he can play ghost-buster . Meanwhile , he gets sidetracked by weird business such as Margery Wilson teetering on the building's parapet . Unfortunately , just as the plot settles into place , that's when interesting things stop happening in this story . SPOILERS NOW . Despite some good camera-work , there's very little attempt to evoke an eerie atmosphere in this film - - no cobwebs , no graveyards - - so we expect the mystery to have a rational explanation that doesn't involve genuine ghosts . And this movie's unusual title turns out to be a handicap , since it makes the solution bang obvious to any modern viewer who's familiar with ' Angel Street ' , ' Scooby Doo ' or several other similar mysteries . Aye , folks : there's a fortune hidden somewhere in the building ( guess the dollar amount ) , and the ' ghosts ' are actually criminals hunting for it . What did surprise me is HOW MANY crooks turn out to be involved in these monkeyshines : there must be at least six of them , which means the booty amounts to less than $5 , 000 per crook , after expenses . ( But that's well over a year's wage for most Americans in 1920 . ) Also , one of the crooks , with the unlikely name Rufus Gaston , is played by Joseph Dowling . . . who was nearly always cast as incorruptible figures . ( Dowling was American movies ' nearest approximation to character actor Samuel S . Hinds before that actor came along . ) Bits and bobs of ' $30 , 000 ' impressed me very much , but this film's premise was doomed to failure in any movie lacking a soundtrack . My rating : just .
436309	9938570	457275	7.0	Altered	Cody , Duke & Otis ( Paul McCarthy-Boyington , Brad William Henke & Michael Williams ) " capture " an alien they supposedly injured to the home of Wyatt ( Adam Kaufman ) . At first , we really don't know what's going on , but find as the characters converge that these young men were all victims of " alien testing " and Wyatt seems to be the token human who was able to outlast the experiments done to him . A dead friend's memory haunts the group as Cody was recently released from the pin for the wrongfully accused death of his brother Timmy . They take pride in capturing the alien , but have no idea that this was all a plan by the aliens to find the whereabouts of Wyatt for whom had been planted with a tracking device he had removed so that he could hide from them . So , the group will have to keep the alien silenced without killing it or risk the race of ET's exterminating the earth . Other problems that emerge . . Wyatt's girlfriend , Foki ( Misty Rosas ) who wants to get away and call the police and a sheriff who answers the call of 911 , Henderson ( James Gammon ) . We learn that if an alien bites you , a type of flesh-eating disease takes hold of the body and that Wyatt seems to have an immunity to it . One of the best " aliens attack " horror / sci-fi hybrids I've seen in ages . It's mostly confined to Wyatt's home as they fight to keep the alien trapped and quiet ( it has it's own tracking device implanted for which Wyatt will remove ) . Cody is unhinged because of being blamed for his brother's murder and holds Wyatt specifically responsible . The film amazingly remains intense because of the alien threat and surprisingly the creature is quite well created by the filmmakers . And , even more stunning is how director Eduardo Sánchez ( of BLAIR WITCH PROJECT fame ) uses dialogue to suggest what happened to these guys instead of showing flashbacks . . this saves a good amount of money , yet elaborates for us what these aliens did . The film has some gory make-up work as it pertains to the nasty flesh-eating disease that attacks one of the group who is bit by the captive alien .
385795	391152	99902	9.0	Just a wrung below Raise the Red Lantern	In ten or twenty years , Zhang Yimou will be regarded as one of the greatest foreign directors . I think his film Raise the Red Lantern is one of the greatest films ever made , easily . Ju Dou is just one step below it . Its positive points are too numerous to mention in any great detail . Just let me warn you that , like almost every movie ever put on video , this film's video / DVD box lies horrendously about what you're about to experience . Ju Dou is not a passionate story of forbidden love . It is not Romeo and Juliette , and you're not going to desire to watch it every Valentine's Day . It is not erotic , but brutal . It is an utterly complex film which is consistently challenging . SPOILERS AHEADThe film starts off pretty conventionally with a mean old man purchasing a young wife in the hopes of producing a son with her . He spends several days beating her into submission . During this period , the old man's nephew , who is treated horribly by his uncle , begins to obsess over his new aunt's beauty . The aunt notices his obsession , and welcomes him as a sort of savior from the cruelty of her husband . We expect a plot where these two find a way to escape their common nemesis , or maybe even kill him . He seems like any other villain to us . The nephew and his aunt produce a child , which is passed off as the old man's . Soon after this , the old man is in an accident and is paralyzed below the waste . Now the young couple has their common tormentor at their mercy , and they use that to their full advantage with horrifying physical and mental torture . They almost instantly tell him that his son is actually the son of his nephew . They build him a tub with wheels ( the Chinese version of a wheelchair ) , and when he misbehaves , they suspend him from the ceiling . This behavior confuses us deeply . What would we do in a similar situation ? Maybe the same thing . But when we see it done , we cannot help but be horrified . Cruelty has begotten cruelty , and everything is spinning out of control . Meanwhile , the young child ages . He has not talked yet , and silently and painfully watches as his mother and cousin cavort , not hiding their lust in the least ( it does turn from passion to lust very quickly ) . The child does not feel that these two have any feelings for him , so he connects to the old man , whom he believes is his father . In fact , his first word comes when the old man is plotting to murder him : " Daddy , " spoken to the old man . The old man is ecstatic , not so much because his " son " has just spoken as because he knows the implications of the child knowing him as his father instead of his cousin . I won't go any further , but this film becomes more painful by the second . My complaints need to be voiced , too . They are few , but key . First , I think that the first half hour or so should have been fleshed out a bit . The relationships and even the characters could have stood to be more developed earlier on . I do not like how Yimou uses slow motion in this film . It does not feel right . My final complaint is with the very end of the film . It is a bit of a cop out , to end the story by burning the house down . I think the only problem in Raise the Red Lantern was also the very end , where Gong Li's character just goes insane . I think it is better to know that the character exists and will have to live with his / her mistakes forever . That is much more powerful , and a better ending . Anyhow , this film is a .
544627	562732	351382	4.0	I'm glad it wasn't called Mt . Tails ?	It is very possible that I simply didn't give the movie a fair enough chance because it was so immediately unappealing to me ( something similar happened with Triplets of Belleville ) , but I really should have caught on when I put the film on and my roommate , an exchange student from Japan , immediately started laughing at the movie , saying that it sounded dumb . Now , I don't agree that it is dumb , the animation is very simple but clearly very skilled . It's like classic animation with added layers that add another element of realism to them while remaining strictly in the realm of the surreal at the same time . But the subject matter is entirely unappealing to me . It has an interesting message about stinginess and greed , but it is wrapped in such an unpleasant package that it is almost not worth learning , especially because you already knew it anyway . The sound effects while the man is loudly gobbling cherries and cherry pits , for example , are indeed repulsive . There was a clever scene of animation as we kept diving endlessly into the hole that the man finds in his head when he pulls the sapling out of his scalp , but it goes on for so long that it seems to overshadow everything else . There is so much stock put into that one sequence that it is almost like the whole movie is about it . As I said about Triplets of Belleville , this would have been a great thing for a late night TV program like adult swim , or its Japanese counterpart , but an Academy Award nominated film ? It gives me the impression that there is not generally a long list of animated short films for the Academy to choose from .
410000	2567136	465538	8.0	The Thinking Man's Jason Bourne	For whatever reason - maybe he needed to prove something , maybe he had little control over the Bournes - Tony Gilroy , who scripted all three of the Bourne movies , has made his directorial debut with a movie as complex as the Bournes but without the relentless violence that marred - for me at least - the trilogy . Plot-wise it could spot a pretzel ten points and , as someone has already pointed out , you need to pay attention otherwise you'll wind up floundering out of your depth . George Clooney gives certainly one of his finer performances and is well supported by the likes of Sydney Pollack , Tilda Swinton and Tom Wilkinson . All told it's a fine effort but one that like so many contemporary movies will probably not stand a second viewing .
548425	1111192	486576	9.0	Not only does the Silver Surfer rise , but also the rest of the Fantastic Four .	This is a summer movie to be sure . It has action , comedy , and a little heart as well . It is not going to win awards , it is not going to be hailed as a cinematic masterpiece , but it is still a very good movie . Add to that it is also short , something all summer movies should aspire to do . Granted , when first I heard of the running time I thought for sure this film would be underdeveloped , however my fears proved groundless as this movie's story was very well done with no loose ends unlike some movie's this year that ran nearly twice as long . I liked it better than the first movie as the comedy was funny and the action was rather nice too . The story has a mysterious force on Earth causing a bit of havoc as water is turned to glass and snow in the deserts . Even strange occurrences happen in Lateveria which is trouble for all . The Fantastic Four though are trying to make a wedding happen while balancing being super heroes and celebrities . The army wants Reed's help to track the force and Reed does , though without Susan's knowledge . Well the big wedding day occurs and it is promptly interrupted by a mysterious being seemingly made of Silver and riding what appears to be a surf board . The Fantastic Four must stop this being and find out his motivations before there is real trouble . Though they do get help in the form of Dr . Doom , which let's face it is probably going to be trouble later on . So yes , there is some good action , comedy and very good special effects . A great fight at the end with who you want to see the Fantastic Four fighting and a nifty climax featuring a very close call . To top it all off you also get out of the movie theater before you age a great deal as well .
459028	2467618	69890	3.0	Subtle , it ain't ! This is one of the silliest films I've seen in some time !	This film sure has a lot of familiar faces - - Bernie Casey , Antonio Fargas , Shelly Winters ( as " Mommy " ) , Esther Role and even Don Cornelius ( from " Soul Train " ) are all here to support Tamara Dobson as Cleopatra Jones . Cleopatra is an extra-special narcotics agent - - practically James Bond and a DEA officer combined ! She knows martial arts , carries a machine gun , drives like a NASCAR driver AND manages to look hot on top of everything else ! It seems that Cleo's efforts have begun to hurt Mommy's businesses and those of her associates - - especially Fargas ' drug dealing . So , it's the mob against Cleopatra . Considering it's only 682 to 1 , it's reasonably certain that Cleo will be victorious by the end of the film . This movie has some similarities to COFFY and FOXY BROWN , as all three films are about an angry woman's attack on the drug trade . One major difference was that in these two Pam Greer films , the title character wasn't a special agent - - just a vigilante wanting to rid the world of dope fiends . Dobson , unlike most other blaxploitation heroes works for " the Man " ! Another difference is that Ms . Dobson manages to keep her clothes on throughout the film ! The final difference is that , believe it or not , Greer's films were a lot more believable , as Dobson can do ANYTHING and is practically Wonderwoman - - whereas , Greer is just really , really mad ! ! Heck , one of the victims even calls Dobson " Wonderwoman " ! Overall , this film is far less gritty blaxploitation and more like an episode of " Get Christie Love " or " Charlie's Angels " - - the music , the plot , the acting - - the whole package . I wonder if Aaron Spelling had anything to do with this project ! !

This is probably one of the worst ( of many bad ) films spun by Jean-Claude Van Damme over the years of his feigning stardom . This screenplay was written obviously by someone with no knowledge of the game , no sense of timing , no feeling for continuity , no love of martial arts , and no understanding of the basics for a good thriller . Why would I say that ? Because this " work " exhibits none of those qualities , while at the same time , it attempts to BE the game . In a word ? EWWW ! The performances are classic " C " movie fare , the dialog delivery will make you cringe or laugh , depending on whether you paid to see this or not , and the execution of the finished product comes off uneven , conflicted , and lost . This just plain sucks . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
437315	306861	22308	10.0	Tale Well Told	A Russian baron evades the violent SCARLET DAWN of the Revolution by escaping Moscow with his faithful serving maid . Here is an excellent little film , from Warner Bros . and director William Dieterle , full of excitement , drama and pre-Code libidinousness . The production values - - sets , costumes , score - - are all first rate and the acting is of a high quality . The picture's only major drawback is its too-brief conclusion , perhaps necessitated by its short overall running time of under an hour , but this does not explain why the film should be so unjustly obscure today . It is a small gem awaiting discovery by viewers appreciative of quality cinema . Douglas Fairbanks Jr is properly dashing as the young nobleman whose life is suddenly tilted upside down by the political upheaval . The actor revels in giving a full-bodied portrayal , presenting a character both wantonly licentious and daringly brave . The sequence in which he dashes into the streets of Constantinople in search of Christian witnesses to his impromptu wedding is delightful in its unexpected sense of frolic & fun . Fairbanks is ably matched by Nancy Carroll , deftly underplaying her role as his adoring servant . The sweetness of her character's simple nature shines through , as well as a steely resolve , as she endures dangers and hardships to be with the man she loves . Lovely Lilyan Tashman , in one of her final roles before her early death , plays the scheming Russian courtesan who hopes to use Fairbanks as her ticket to the good life in Paris . Guy Kibbee , a very popular character actor at Warner's , appears for only a few moments at the end of the movie as a wealthy American visiting the Levant . Movie mavens will recognize Mischa Auer as a Russian cavalry officer ; beefy Dewey Robinson as a Bolshevik thug ; nervous Frank Reicher as a duplicitous pawnbroker ; as well as Mae Busch & Lee Kohlmar as the wedding witnesses - - all uncredited .

Wasn't the original film about artifacts ? Shouldn't they stick to what worked ? ) Et cetera ? This Indiana Jones movie , however , gets back on track , like I said before . It just ' feels ' more like an Indiana Jones movie . Harrison Ford is ( once again ) completely believable as Indiana Jones . As I said in my ' Raiders ? ' review ( which can be found on this same site ) , Ford's character is not as gungo-ho as the stereotypical adventure hero . We feel he carries out his missions with a smug smirk because he is ? simply ? Indiana Jones , and that is what he must do . Sean Connery is excellent as Indiana's father , completely convincing as an ex-adventurer who still has it in him for one last go as a daredevil . A Scottish father for Indy may seem a bit weird , but really , is it ? John Rhys-Davies returns to his ' Raiders ? ' role with a warm welcome ? he is still utterly loveable and moving as his character . And then there is young River Phoenix , who makes a small appearance in the beginning of the film as a teenaged Indiana Jones . I love the entire beginning sequence , because not only does it give us a glimpse into the background of the Jones character ( motivation behind it all , etc . ) but also , we find out how Indy got his nickname ( Phoenix walks into the Jones residence and we find out his pet dog's name is Indiana ) . And then there are the great locations , cinematography and excellent tongue-in-cheek gags that may not be as good as the original film , but to me , finalize the Jones chapter in concrete . That is why I am a bit sad to hear another sequel has been planned . It will be nice to see Indy again , but is it really necessary ? I think that at Ford's age ? sixty-something ? Ford will come across as more of a cripple than any hero . Still , I'll be one of the first in line to see it when it ( eventually ) comes out . I'd have to give ' Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade ' stars . ' Raiders of the Lost Ark ' gets , and ' Indiana ? Temple of Doom ' gets . Kudos to Spielberg , Lucas , Ford , Connery , Davies and Phoenix , plus all the others who made the trilogy what it is today . stars - John Ulmer
551283	989035	61107	6.0	Despite incredible moments , a disappointment from the Master of Suspense	American nuclear scientist Paul Newman defects in East Germany , but is he serious or just setting the Germans up as pawns ? Espionage drama from director Alfred Hitchcock , with Julie Andrews a curious choice as the proverbial girlfriend ( she was forced upon Hitch by the head of Universal ) . The production is extremely plush - - too plush for the gritty on-screen happenings . Some of the set-ups have that carpeted , artificial Hollywood look that doesn't do much for the players on-screen nor the audience . The screenplay is heavy with talk , and Hitchcock can't shake out the cobwebs ; the pacing is dirge-like most of the way . Newman and Andrews give just-OK lead performances , but there are the requisite pleasures in such a film , particularly one colorful murder scene involving an oven . Not a memorable film by any means , but passable for Hitchcock completists . from
533496	70535	35218	7.0	The James Gang invades the Army	How many of these pro war propaganda movies did Hollywood grind out in the early 40's ? I've seen several , and there isn't much difference among any of them . Here we have the entire Harry James orchestra joining the military in a fervor of patriotism ; the boys just can't wait to fight . This film is the usual " let's all go do battle for God and country " malarkey , spiced up with a generous portion of song and dance . And some really bad comedy . Not to mention some extremely bad acting by Harry himself .
401548	7743887	75537	8.0	" Squeeze me please ! I am hopping to be unrolled ! "	Vince Powell came up with the idea for this L . W . T . sitcom after his au pair innocently asked him one day if he had received any ' French letters ' for her . She was of course referring to mail , but to an English comedy scriptwriter the double meaning was unmistakable . ' Mind Your Language ' was set in an adult education centre where foreign students struggle to master the complexities of the English language . They include a sexy French girl , a Spaniard fond of saying ' Por favore ? ' a lot , a Mao-quoting Chinese woman , a hot-blooded Italian , a surly German woman , a fast-talking Greek , a head-waggling Indian lady , and a Chinaman who gets to his feet and takes a bow whenever asked a question . Later additions were a Swedish sex-bomb and a confused Hungarian . Presiding over this microcosm of international relations was well-meaning but naive English teacher Jeremy Brown , played by the late Barry Evans . The show provided a welcome return for the popular actor , who had been off British television screens since ' Doctor At Large ' in 1971 . Also around were Mary Whitehouse lookalike Zara Nutley as the fearsome principal ' Miss Courtney ' , Tommy Godfrey ( ' Arthur ' in Powell's ' Love Thy Neighbour ' ) as ' Sid ' the caretaker , and Iris Sadler as tea lady ' Gladys ' . ' Mind Your Language ' is often cited as an example of ' racist ' ' 70's British comedy . I personally think it is no more offensive than those American movies that depict the British either as plummy-voiced toffs or chirpy Cockney sparrows . The main source of ridicule in this show is the English language itself . Yes , the students were stereotypes , but British comedy has always been full of them - check out ' Fawlty Towers ' for yet more ' funny foreigners ' . Manuel could easily have been one of Jeremy Brown's students . Besides , the English characters were also stereotypes . The students themselves came across as altogether likable . This was never intended to be serious social commentary . My main bugbear is that the characters never developed from one episode to the next ; it would have been nice to have seen say , the students gradually mastering English , coming to understand each other's customs , maybe even getting married ( Danielle and Giovanni would have made a nice couple ) . Michael Grade axed the show despite its popularity , yet in 1986 it returned as an independent production , courtesy of one of its stars - Albert Moses . If he - an Asian actor - did not find the show offensive , why on Earth should anyone else ? Superbly parodied by L . W . T . ' s ' End Of Part One ' as ' Mind Your Foreigners ' .

438411	1617546	35113	6.0	The Art of Redemption	This pretty good propaganda programmer has officer George Murphy fouling up , being busted out and reenlisting as a common sailor , where he runs into Pat O'Brien and Jane Wyatt , Murphy's ex-fiancée and O'Brien's sister . It's interesting to watch the two stock Irishmen play off of each other , each in their usual registers : Murphy easy-going and O'Brien in his bulldog mode . The story also takes some interesting and unexpected turns that raise it above the usual level of flag waving propaganda . Somehow a Viennese violist and Desi Arnaz wind up in the crew for some comic relief and plot purposes . RKO's technical department , the equal of any in the business , came up with a new machine to simulate the effects of horizon on the sea . Looks pretty good .
512708	3223254	416320	10.0	An Engrossing , Brilliantly Played Work of Chamber Music	Woody Allen is always at his finest when he stays away from self-parody : the man can write and direct brilliantly and create solid gems of cultural / society examinations with the best of them ! MATCH POINT is a case in point . From the opening credits , to the keenly meaningful voice-over about the significance of luck in molding the course of our lives , to the arresting pause of a tennis ball frozen in its rise from a struck net before falling to either side , to the use of scratchy Enrico Caruso recordings - all of these are indications that Allen is about to lead us into a world defined by walking on razor blade edges . Match Point is an intelligent , burnished , glowing little masterpiece of movie making , a thriller that keeps the viewer bound until the surprise ending . Chris ( Jonathan Rhys Meyers , groomed and handsome and magnetic in his first role as a non-quirky oddball ) is a lower middle class ex tennis pro who begins his new life as a tennis teacher in a wealthy club where he encounters the Hewett family , a family of immense wealth lead by a benevolent father ( Brian Cox ) , a class conscious mother ( Penelope Wilton ) , a handsome son Tom ( Matthew Goode ) who is dating a middle class American wannabe actress Nola ( Scarlett Johansson ) , and daughter Chloe ( Emily Mortimer ) . Chris ' good looks and manners win the family's affection and he is melded into the fabric of wealth through his attention to Chloe and his movement into the father's business . Sadly for all Chris is attracted to the sensuous Nola who , despite her physical attraction for Chris , knows the steps to climb up the ladder to wealth by being engaged to Tom . Chris falls in love with his new life of luxury , marries Chloe who wants to have children immediately , and yet he lusts for Nola . In time Nola and Tom part ( the reason to be outlined later in the film ) and though hesitant to shake Chris ' marriage to Chloe , Nola becomes physically involved with Chris . The inherent dangers of Chris ' infidelity grow to tragic proportions and his knotty dilemma of choosing his new life of comfort versus his lust for Nola result in bits and pieces of luck that determine the outcome of the film . For this viewer it is difficult to fault any aspect of this film : the cinematography by Remi Adefarasin is not only stunning visually - it also captures the tension of the film in mixing tight shots with panoramas isolating the characters in motion of betrayal ; the film's music score is almost entirely opera excerpts from old Caruso recordings ( know the opera excerpts and the story is enhanced ! ) and from ' live ' stage performances at Covent Garden ( superb singing and staging oddly accompanied by only a piano ! ) . But the brilliance of this ensemble is Allen's keenly sensitive eye and timing and pacing of a suspense thriller that always has as its base a fine dollop of social comment and lusty romance . The cast is impeccable , from the consistently superb smaller roles to the tour de force acting of Jonathan Rhys Meyers , Scarlett Johansson , and Emily Mortimer . This is clearly one of the finest works of Woody Allen's long career and hopefully he will continue along this vein . Highly Recommended . Grady Harp
401139	7743887	675779	9.0	Food , Inglorious Food !	Mrs . Savage is the chief cook at Fenn Street School , and the one thing that pupils and teachers can all agree on is that her food is absolutely terrible . The only person unaware of this is Mr . Cromwell , mainly because Potter has been substituting his meals with ones made by his wife Ruby . The wily caretaker has a scam going ; in return for keeping Mrs . Savage in the job , he gets free groceries . When Hedges ventures into the kitchens to confront the cook , she loses her temper and resigns . The new cook is far better . But once again Potter conceals the truth from the headmaster by swapping his dinner . Mr . Cromwell reinstates Mrs . Savage , much to the disgust of the school . . . I was lucky . The standard of food at my school was uniformly excellent . We did not have a ' Mrs . Savage ' slaving over our stoves . The lady herself is played by the late Pat Nye , the only woman who could conceivably have given Peggy Mount a run for her money in the ' battleaxe ' stakes . ' On The Buses ' fans may remember her as ' Mrs . Blake ' from the Season 7 episode ' The Visit ' . As well as being a bullying , bad-tempered cow , her lack of hygiene is deplorable . Note the scene where she shakes her hair all over the stew , before complaining there are hairs in it ! Jo Rowbottom is seen as sexy barmaid ' Elsie ' . A few years later , she would play James Beck's wife in the Ronald Wolfe & Ronald Chesney scripted I . T . V . sitcom ' Romany Jones ' . Funniest moment - Hedges and Price looking forward to a pie in their local , only to discover the new cook is none other than Mrs . Savage !
450871	2093818	105112	7.0	Not necessarily bad	I haven't read the novel , but apparently it wouldn't make much of a difference ; Clancy wanted nothing to do with this after reading the first draft . This is perhaps not really a movie based on a book of his , rather more of a Ford one loosely based on an original piece of writing . That doesn't have to be a negative aspect . It's put together just fine . The plot is emotional and straightforward , especially ( although not only ) compared to The Hunt for Red October . The pacing is reasonable , it's not downright boring . The dialog is plain and unmemorable , if not poor . The acting is sufficient . The characters aren't particularly layered , and one or two could be cut with seemingly no impact on the overall thing . Has Sam Jackson ever seemed so insignificant , before or since ? This tries harder to appeal to the masses , mainly by implying sex and being crass . The violence isn't that strong . The language , however , is harsher and in greater amount than its predecessor , with no justification . The action is relatively plentiful ( albeit not enough for this to go entirely work as that , nor can it be called an all-out political thriller . . . they should have picked a direction and stuck with it , in my opinion ) in this , and it's well-done and entertaining . I recommend this to those looking for lighter fare than the preceding entry in the series , and fans of Harrison .
584731	1219578	291542	4.0	Juliette capitulates . Romeo is moaning .	The pregnant girl ( and of course unmarried ) has always been the permanent feature in the French cinema of the south of France . Blame it on Marcel Pagnol ! Recently " La Ville est tranquille " was an updated version of Pagnol's classics of the thirties / forties . " Le Ventre de Juliette " is more of the same . All that concerns Juliette and Matthias is endearing and the two actors J . Parmentier and S . Rideau are both convincing . Unfortunately , the supporting actors are left to their own device . Their characters are caricatures and they overplay as hell . The mother looks like a Pedro Almodovar's heroine lost in " Whatever happened to Baby Jane ? " ( like in Aldrich's classic , she was a star when she was a child and her blockbuster in Argentina was a version of " Goldilocks and the Three Bears " which she watches again and again on her video ) . " Fafa " , Juliette's sister ( and her bourgeois husband ) is really a pain in the neck , and I'm polite . And the viewer who has not guessed who Juliette's father is after his second appearance is a moron . ( no need for waiting the mother's " explanations " ) Both the beginning and the ending display the same pretension .

399334	1391795	374102	7.0	A gripping little movie about the will to survive .	Busy young couple Susan ( Blanchard Ryan ) and Daniel ( Daniel Travis ) take time for a vacation in a tropical paradise , but when they go on a deep sea dive and get separated from the main group , they find themselves alone in the open ocean , for hours on end . Well , not quite alone . . . before too long they start to get circled by sharks . " Open Water " deserves some credit for basically getting us to stay interested with only two actors on screen for the balance of the picture , and for maintaining a steady feeling of danger . This wouldn't work at all if the two leads weren't likable or sympathetic or interesting enough to command our attention , and Ryan and Travis do an acceptable job in this regard . Director , writer , editor , and cinematographer Chris Kentis emphasizes their isolation at all times , keeping the feeling of unease going especially once the sharks start to be introduced . If you are like me , you will constantly be expecting an attack to happen , and be dreading it . Kentis and wife / fellow cinematographer Laura Lau do a creditable job with a low budget ; both avid scuba divers , their inspiration for this movie was a true story of a couple who had themselves been left behind by a diving boat in the waters of Australia . Enhanced by Graeme Revells ' subtly chilling music , " Open Water " is a rather effective , efficiently made movie that easily rivals anything one might find in a conventional Hollywood film . I thought that it worked quite well , and give it my recommendation .
519170	8239592	78748	10.0	Why this landmark sci-fi / horror classic still works	There are several reasons why this remarkably taut , scary and effective science fiction / horror hybrid holds up so well to this very day . 1 . ) The premise ingeniously mixes elements from two separate , yet compatible genres into a strong and satisfying synthesis . The futuristic outer space setting is pure sci-fi , but the grotesque monster , ghastly gore and spooky mood are sheer gut-wrenching horror all the way . 2 . ) The plausibly drab and bleak depiction of a frightfully possible future . There's nothing slick or shiny about the future shown in this picture . It's truly grim and grimy , with the grungy set design , grubby costumes and rundown looking spaceship all contributing to one fascinatingly credible version of a future that seems just around the corner . The all-powerful company's cold assessment of the crew as expendable isn't too far removed from the world we currently live in - - a world in which greed and money take precedent over the basic worth ascribed to everyday human life . 3 . ) The gradual pace . While there are some folks who take issue with the methodically slow pace , said pace nonetheless is crucial to developing the almost unbearably substantial amount of suspense that really kicks into harrowing overdrive once the creature gets lose on the ship . It's the meticulous build-up of the first half which gives the second half of the film its considerable nerve-wracking impact and potency . 4 . ) The infamous " chest-burster " scene . It's so supremely well-timed and staged , with highly believable mixed reactions from everyone involved in the scene . 5 . ) The uniformly superlative acting from a top-notch cast . Sigourney Weaver positively shines in her break-out star-making role as tough sole survivor Ripley , with stellar support from Tom Skerritt , Yaphet Kotto , Ian Holm , John Hurt , Veronica Cartwright , and the always terrific Harry Dean Stanton . 6 . ) Jerry Goldsmith's exceptional score . Ace composer Goldsmith chimes in with one of his most brilliantly spare and chilling scores ever . 7 . ) The thoroughly convincing warts'n'all human characters . The way the well-drawn characters bicker and interact with each other rings completely true throughout . 8 . ) The strikingly gloomy cinematography by Derek Vanlint gives this feature a supremely powerful dark'n'shadowy atmospheric look . 9 . ) The still quite sound and cogent special effects . Done prior to CGI , those miniatures have an organic quality to them that's extremely persuasive . 10 . ) That hideously vile , nasty and downright creepy alien itself . Sure , it's just a guy in a suit , but wow does that suit seem incredibly genuine and lifelike . 11 . ) Ridley Scott's faultless direction never wavers from start to finish , keeping the absorbing story on track while delivering plenty of jolts and cranking up the clammy claustrophobic tension to the often exhilarating ninth degree . Add all these sterling factors together and the net result is a simply spectacular motion picture that's wholly deserving of its classic status .
490287	33913	111958	10.0	This show might offend some Catholics but not me , I loved It	I have to say that I was surprised at my amazement of enjoying this Irish comedy . Sadly , the actor played Father Ted died in 1998 . But he left us with lots of laughter and unforgettable scenes . It used to be shown on WLIW and they began putting warnings before the show . Then , it may have gotten a little too offensive for a New York Catholic audience . But despite everything , it is a classic comedic series . You'll laugh more than be offended . Maybe a few people in the television audience might answer their true callings of priesthood and sisterhood . We need more religious people . Maybe in a way , Father Ted shows a fun side of priest life without the stuffiness associated with it . Priests can and do have fun . They're even hysterical to watch over and over again . You can't forget the wonderful Mrs . Doyle as the bit crazed housekeeper to the priests . Don't miss the Lent episode and Father Stone episode . They are just too funny to miss up this show's offer .
491664	3280905	120686	8.0	Worthy expansion and remake of " No Sad Songs For Me "	Sometimes a great star is able to make a final screen appearance that his or her fans realize is fitting their stature . Spencer Tracy did it with his final screen speech to Katherine Hepburn and the cast of GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER about the lingering passions in his elderly frame towards the woman he actually did love . Paul Muni did it too in his last film , THE LAST ANGRY MAN , giving a performance as a true humanitarian doctor in his final days . Laird Cregar did it in those concluding , unforgettable shots of his mad musician in " Hell " in the burning conclusion of HANGOVER SQUARE . And Margaret O'Sullivan did it as the terminally ill mother and wife determined to have her family secured by a worthy second wife ( Vivica Lindfors ) in NO SAD SONGS FOR ME . O'Sullivan left a small output of films compared to her fellow female stars of the 1930s - 1940s , but they were mostly good performances in such films as THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER , THE GOOD FAIRY , THREE COMRADES . and THE MORTAL STORM . She never won the Oscar , but she is recognized as one of the finest actresses of her age . The ultimate tragedy of her life - the emotional troubles that led to her suicide in 1960 - reinforce the sense of loss in her curtailed movie career as much as the death of James Dean does for him or the cancer that killed Judy Holliday a few years after O'Sullivan died . The film NO SAD SONGS FOR ME was remade in 1998 with a first rate cast and expanded . STEPMOM demonstrates how a remake can help redefine the characters of the original film and even make them more interesting . In NO SAD SONGS FOR ME , O'Sullivan moves silently for most of the film to manipulate husband Wendell Corey into seeing Lindfors as a worthy replacement for herself . But this is a little hard to believe ( though the acting of O'Sullivan makes it acceptable ) . Instead the remake forces Susan Sarandon ( in the O'Sullivan part ) to make 180 degree reversal for the sake of her ex-husband and kids . Instead of a placid household disrupted by on-coming tragedy , Sarandon's household is disrupted initially by her husband ( Ed Harris ) two-timing her with his new love Julia Roberts . Harris wants a divorce , and being a successful professional man he can give Sarandon a lot of money . But Sarandon is furious at the slap in her face and in the opening of the film she confronts both Harris and Roberts about their adultery . Her anger also spills over into resentment by her children ( Jena Malone and Liam Aiken ) who fully side with Mom . It is after the divorce that she learns the truth about her health problems . But there are methods of handling the cancer in 1998 unavailable to Margaret O'Sullivan in 1950 . Methods like chemotherapy . Sarandon ( who is determined to beat back her illness ) tries these methods , and leaves the scene to explore these treatments . Meanwhile Roberts finds she is trying to maintain her photography career and to somehow overcome the resentment of the two step-children . Now all this additional material enables the main thrust of the original story to make a trifle more sense . For after Sarandon finds all the treatments to be unworkable she returns to see what can be salvaged in her limited remaining time . This means making an alliance with the suspicious Roberts . . . one that eventually does soften into a close friendship as they both find each other's finer qualities . Not that Sarandon is really happy at what is going to happen to her . In one of the film's best scenes she vents to Roberts her total anger that she will not be alive to see her daughter get married . The venting actually helps break down the final walls between the two women . Slowly , as Harris , Malone , and Aiken become aware of the impending tragedy , the family unit expands to make room again for Sarandon as she makes sure she and her children spend as much time together as possible . And Roberts makes sure that Sarandon's intentions for the two children are carried out ( which enables her to finally win their trust and affections ) . The best moment in this section of the film is Roberts making sure that Malone is avenged against an obnoxious ex-boyfriend at her high school , where ( with Sarandon's approval ) Roberts uses a male model she knows and some special dialog ( regarding a disgusting sex act ) to humiliate the boy before his friends . NO SAD SONGS FOR ME was a great conclusion to a fine actress's screen career . STEPMOM was a first rate remake and expansion of that film enabling two of our finest current leading actresses to share the screen in two equally memorable parts .
572027	4248714	112722	6.0	Copycat	From director Jon Amiel ( Entrapment , The Core ) this is quite an interesting murder mystery suspense thriller with two very good actresses . Basically Dr . Helen Hudson ( Sigourney Weaver ) used to be a criminal psychologist , specialising in serial killers , before she viciously attacked by Daryll Lee Cullum ( The Iron Giant's Harry Connick Jr . ) , and she now suffers agoraphobia ( panics when she tries to leave her house ) . Now a vicious killer , creating murder scenes replicating past infamous serial killers , i . e . copycatting , and detectives M . J . Monahan ( Holly Hunter ) and Reuben Goetz ( Dermot Mulroney ) are hoping Hudson can help them . Unfortunately , the killer , Peter Foley ( William McNamara ) , knows about Helen , and is constantly sending her reminders of her horrific experience , so it is a challenge for Helen . Killers copycatted by the way include The Hillside Strangler , David Berkowitz , Jeffrey Dahmer and Ted Bundy , and of course when the killer eventually gets Helen he creates the scene she was involved in . Also starring J . E . Freeman as Lt . Thomas Quinn , Will Patton as Nicoletti , John Rothman as Andy and Shannon O'Hurley as Susan Schiffer . Weaver and Hunter both have their moments , the story is obvious but certainly made to look interesting . Good !
490824	33913	108775	8.0	A Talented Cast of Strong Women !	I don't know why some shows get canceled . This show related to one of my co-workers when I worked at the supermarket about an overbearing mother-in-law played by the Oscar winner Eileen Heckart . Her daughters-in-law were played by Broadway professional veterans like Judith Ivey and Harriet Sansom Harris as well as soap veteran actress Charlotte Ross and Beth Broderick . The husbands were rarely shown because it was really a show centered around the relationships between the sisters-in-laws and their mother-in-law . The newest in-law was played by Charlotte Ross . Beth Broderick played the more sensual wife while Judith Ivey's character was Jewish and the oldest of all the Buchanan wives . Harriet Sansom Harris was divine as the snobby wife who is always a show stopper in any performance . Of course there was Eileen Heckart who can make a great entrance and say more with a facial expression than a thousand words .
484408	1416505	443706	8.0	In the search for truth and answers .	The movie is a realistic retelling of the events involving the Zodiac killer . Crimes that as of yet still haven't been solved . The movie is told from many different viewpoints , such as the reporters that receive his letters and the police . Because of the different approaches the movie always knows to grab your attention and interest , without having to ever fall back onto some Hollywood clichés . It of course helps that the writer of the novel Robert Graysmith worked himself on this movie project for years . The story at all times is kept realistic . Some people might find it odd and distracting that the movie focuses on so many different characters and the movie doesn't really have one main character who's solving the crimes . What I loved most about the movie was that it without problems crosses 4 different decades . The movie begins in the late ' 60's , then the ' 70's and for a small part even the ' 80's and ' 90's . The atmosphere , style of movie-making is all consistent with the decade the movie is set in at the moment . The movie knows to re-create a perfect ' 60's and ' 70's look , in a very detailed and realistic way . I think this mostly explains the movie its very high budget . The movie also shows how an interest for something can turn into an obsession . It does this subtle and non-forced . I also liked it that the movie never got too personal or close with any of the characters within the movie . This type of movie could had easily been turned into a over-dramatized one , but the movie deliberately focuses purely on the one main essence of the movie ; Who is the Zodiac killer ? A question that of course gets never answered within the movie but the search for the answer alone is already a tense and exciting long process . The movie is filled with some big-name actors , such as Robert Downey Jr . I like how he always seems to play a caricature of himself . And eccentric , free-spirit , drug / drink addict . He's great in his role in this movie ! Jake Gyllenhaal has never convinced me before of being the right man - and have the capabilities of playing a main character and carry an entire movie but with this movie he comes close of showing he can do it . Other actors that give a nice performance in this movie are Mark Ruffalo and Elias Koteas , among others , while other big name actors play some very small parts in the movie , such as Brian Cox , Adam Goldberg and Clea DuVall . It's far from David Fincher's best work , but that says more something about the qualities of Fincher than about this actual movie .
422708	2248099	67243	6.0	Interesting British attempt at making a Giallo	Assault is apparently a British attempt at emulating the popular Italian Giallo sub-genre . If that is indeed what the filmmakers were aiming for , it has to be said that they've done a rather good job , as Assault incorporates many of the common Giallo trademarks . We've got a killer on the loose , a number of victims , a police investigation , an eyewitness , lots of red herrings and an unknown assailant , among other things . I'd even go as far as to say that if I didn't know better , I might have thought this was an Italian production , set in the UK . It's unfortunate , then , that director Sidney Hayers wasn't able to take the script and craft an exciting mystery out of it , as the film features far too much talking and not enough action , leaving it caught up in boredom for most of the running time . The plot follows the murder of a young girl in the woods outside of her school . When another is found dead in the same way shortly after , the police are brought in . Their only witness is a young teacher , who says the killer looks like the devil and puts herself on the line to catch the psychopath . One common element of the Italian Giallo is a silly plot , and that has been copied for this film also . The idea regarding the capture of the killer is preposterous , and the murderer would have to be a complete and utter fool to fall for it . The film doesn't seem too keen on keeping itself away from complete farce either , as the climax is very silly and it's often hard to keep a straight face while watching the film unfold , and that's not what you want from a thriller that handles themes of murder and rape . The cast is distinctly British , and Derbyshire-born Giallo star Suzy Kendall , who has also worked with the likes of Dario Argento , Sergio Martino and Umberto Lenzi on Giallo thrillers , takes the lead role and is joined by a host of tea-drinking co-stars . Sidney Hayers ' direction is a little turgid at times , although scenes such as the one in which we get an early glimpse of the murderer are well shot . The conclusion to the mystery is disappointing , as the identity of the killer just sort of comes out of nowhere . Overall , this film isn't all that good ; but it may appeal to Giallo fans for the fact that it's a Giallo , but it's not Italian .
484504	1416505	109707	10.0	A brilliant movie about a not so brilliant man .	When you see an Indian organist playing in a meat-house with the meat still cooling in it , while a transvestite is performing a belly dance without his teeth and is making Bela Lugosi swing , you know it . . . you're watching a Tim Burton movie . The movie brilliantly tells the story about Edward D . Wood Jr . widely know these days as the worst movie director of all time . It tells the story with lot's of humor but it never gets disrespectful , or makes fun of Wood . Instead you actually will gain lot's of respect for his passion and his will power to make just that one movie that he would always be remembered for . The story of Edward D . Wood Jr . is tragic but the movie never becomes sad . It is the perfect homage and tribute to this unfortunate director . You can see by watching this movie that Tim Burton in a way really admires Wood's life and his work . We get to see Wood as a filmmaker and as an individual . We get to know his weird lifestyle and his eccentric famous friendsOK the movie might no be a completely fair biography about Wood . It takes lot's of liberties with telling the story and it only shows the bright days of Wood's life but as movie it works really well and is next to " Edward Sciccorhands " Burton's best movie till date , truly a masterpiece ! The cast is terrific . Johnn Depp in a Tim Burton movie is always jackpot . Sarah Jessica Parker impressed me and Martin Landau truly is perfect as Bela Lugosi . Bill Murray does what he can best , acting crazy ! The Danny Elfman like music by Howard Shore is really great and also great as an homage to the 50's horror soundtracks . The movie works both as a comedy and as a drama . It knows to find the perfect balance but mainly still the movie is just extremely fun to watch . The movie really has tons of laughs and is filled with some incredible crazy character's but like I said before , it never becomes disrespectful to anyone . I must say that " Ed Wood " really changed my life . It got me interested in not just only Ed Wood movies but 50's horror movies in general . It also made me a big fan of the famous Hammer film's . A brilliant , strange , tragic , fun homage to the man who will always be remembered as the worst director of all time .
385853	391152	165854	8.0	This Movie Was Sweeter Than Curly Fries	This film was quite good . The acting was top-notched . Terence Stamp was excellent . Apparently , the real-life limeys thought that his Cockney accent wasn't good , but it wasn't grating . I thought that he perfectly expressed emotion . He played an extremely complex character . I felt a genuine sense of pathos for him . Even better was Peter Fonda . I think this role of his was the best I've ever seen , better than Ulee's Gold or Easy Rider ( which wasn't really an actor's movie , so don't crucify me for that comment ) . He was certainly not the standard Hollywood scumbag producer whom we see in a lot of movies which take place in that place . He was actually kind of likeable . Though he had done plenty of bad things , he seemed to have been trying make amends with his past . Notice how he acts around his girlfriend . When I saw her , I thought , " Oh boy , another Hollywood fantasy where an aging man sleeps with an extremely young girl . " But it was never like that . Fonda seemed to really care about her , as if he were trying to right the wrong that he did to Jennifer . And his girlfriend did not seem empty-headed . She was kind . She was genuinely interested in her lover's past . It was not as if she was just there for the money . But the crazy jump shots and weird editing really took away from the film . In fact , it was so annoying that I gave this film an 8 instead of the 10 it should have been . I liked the way the director narrated some of the background information over Wilson's journey to the place of illegal business to which Eddie drove Jennifer . There is this sort of editing , and it leads into a quick burst of carefully directed violence . Very effective . What I disliked was the way there would be a shot of a character standing there with his mouth shut while the same person would be speaking in a voice-over . Now that was grating ! The flashbacks were sort of hackneyed , also . Many , many movies show flashbacks in a blurry or grainy film stock . This editing was so distracting , that I bet a lot of people will hate it just for that . It takes away from the great story and acting . Without that editing , it would have been better than Out of Sight .
493743	342623	44725	7.0	Peter Lawford as a jewel thief in Victorian England	The theft of an emerald coincides with a policeman's murder by a serial killer in " The Hour of 13 , " starring Peter Lawford , Dawn Addams , Roland Culver , and Derek Bond . Lawford stars as Nicholas Revel , an attractive young man in league with a ring of thieves that steals jewels and then gives them back to the insurance company and collects the reward . Unfortunately , " The Terror , " a murderer who targets the bobbies of London , has just struck his latest victim on the property Revel is inside robbing . The police assume the murderer also stole the emerald . Revel needs to solve the case , or help the police solve it , so that the stone can be delivered without anyone being arrested . Scotland Yard becomes suspicious . Peter Lawford is plenty dreamy-looking in this film and his speaking voice is devastating . What a shame he was content to drink , hang with Frank , and play " Password . " He was really something . " The Hour of 13 " is entertaining , though no great shakes . Its atmosphere is studio-manufactured and loaded with dry ice for fog effects . If you like the urbane , Raffles type of thief , you'll enjoy this .
571095	4248714	338348	5.0	The Polar Express	I saw snippets of Final Fantasy : The Spirits Within , and of course , Beowulf , and thought the computer animation looked brilliantly realistic , and then I got the chance to see this one that I had heard about . This film from director Robert Zemeckis ( Back to the Future , Forrest Gump , Beowulf ) sees the introduction of a new form of CGI that transfers the live actions of actors into a digital format , this is called " Performance Capture " . Anyway , based on the storybook by Chris Van Allsburg , it sees the Hero Boy doubting the existence of Santa Claus , and Christmas Eve night a magical train suddenly appears in the middle of the street . The train's conductor ( Tom Hanks ) invites him on The Polar Express to the North Pole , and at the last minute , the boy jumps on . Many other boys and girls have got on the train hoping to see Santa Claus , who is going to give a special present to a child of his choice . The journey sees tickets almost being lost , blizzard , iced over tracks and many other complications . they eventually reach the North Pole , and after a little turn , Hero Boy , Hero Girl ( Nona Gaye ) , Know-It-All ( Eddie Deezen , I recognised his voice immediately , he plays Mandark from Dexter's Laboratory ) and Lonely Boy ( Peter Scolari ) get to the ceremony just in time , and Santa ( Hanks again ) obviously chooses Hero Boy , probably because of his doubt earlier . I don't understand why he asked Santa for a sleigh bell , but on the other hand I suppose it is to help him remember that Santa does exist . Hanks also plays the Hobo and Scrooge . The animation is immaculate in detail , it must have taken them ages to get it as perfect as it is , it is just a shame the story is really , really cheesy . It was nominated the Oscar for Best Song for " Believe " , which also won a Grammy and was nominated the Golden Globe , Best Sound Editing and Best Sound Mixing , and it was nominated the BAFTA Children's Award for Best Feature Film . Worth watching !
405595	2020269	82133	3.0	Some stories are better left . . . untold	I'm probably one of the few people in the world who don't automatically categorize Joe D'Amato's film as ' worthless ' or ' sleazy junk ' . No , I actually support the opinion that he's a filmmaker with vision . With films like ' Buried Alive ' , ' Death Smiles at Murder ' and ' Emanuelle and the Last Cannibals ' he proved that he's capable of combining gruesome horror images and gore with a compelling script . This film , however , completely takes the edge off the above stated opinion . Caligula : The Untold Story is a very ugly and mediocre film about history's most notorious figure . Following Tinto Brass ' controversial cult-epic , D'Amato focuses on the cruel and inhuman reign of the Roman emperor . This film particularly handles about a personal vendetta between a Moor-woman ( whose friend got brutally killed ) and the Emperor . She's torn between her personal feelings and her urge to take vengeance bla bla bla ? Caligula is a non-stop series of uninteresting sleaze , lame gore , terrible acting skills and inferior production values . The film starts out well enough , with a great cameo from Michele Soavi ( later the director of masterpieces like ' Dellamorte Dellamore ' ) trying to kill Caligula but , after this , it all goes downhill . David Cain is an incredibly bad actor and even the gorgeous Laura ' Black Emanuelle ' Gemser doesn't look sensual enough to keep you watching . This film reminded me a lot about history lessons in school . The substance is fascinating enough , but it's brought in such a tedious and dull way . You're way better of watching Brass ' epic staring Malcolm McDowell .

432396	2171244	492496	8.0	Eating Disorders 101	One of the best documentaries of last year . If you know anyone who has an eating disorder , then this film will give you a clear insight into their behavior , and also into treatment facilities , and why they fail . I am so against the behavior-based practices of facilities like the one depicted in this movie . They are so about rules and really do not get into the whys . You will leave this film at the end not having any more understanding of why someone would exist on 200 calories a day , than you did in the beginning . It is no wonder that most go back to their behaviors when they leave . No one addressed the inner demons . It is all " Just Say NO , " and we know how that works on the drug problem or keeping teens from having sex . You can't help feeling sorry for these girls . You know they are destined to continue in their hell . Thank you , Lauren Greenfield , for introducing us to them .
434098	2171244	95882	3.0	Oh Thrill !	The only thing that saved this from a total waste was the presence of Leslie Easterbrook , who made two very interesting points throughout the entire film . I especially liked her " Ride of the Valkyries " yell as she sped up in the swamp boat . Of course , parts of her arrived long before the boat . I was glad to see her return as well as G . W . Bailey along with the regulars : Bubba Smith , David Graf , Michael Winslow Leslie Easterbrook , and George Gaynes . Most of the movie was unfortunately focused on Easterbrook's breasts and Bailey's bumbling attempts at gaining attention . Tackleberry was funny as usual with his over-the-top gung-ho attitude . But really not worth the time .
525624	4445210	86190	9.0	One Of The Best In The Series	Up until the sixth and last episode of the Star Wars saga , which finally ended in 2005 , I had always looked at this 1983 entry as my favorite film of the long-running series . The varied action scenes and really different characters ( Jabba The Hut , furry woodland creatures , etc . ) made this a particularly appealing movie . None of the action ever focused too long in one spot , either . The last half hour exemplifies this the most as the scene switches every few minutes from the woods to the battle among space ships to the individual laser-duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader . Another nice characteristic this film had that the two previous did not was the absence of in-fighting between two of the stars . Gone was the incessant bickering between Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford . Finally , everyone was on the same page ! It was nice to see . In the end , this was simply a wonderful adventure tale , more than anything else .
514699	317399	1016205	5.0	A Nutshell Review : The Mourning Forest	Winning the Grand Prix of the Cannes Film Festival last year , I actually found it a tad difficult to appreciate this piece by Naomi Kawase , as compared to Shara . I am beginning to suspect that I have a profound disengagement with movies that deal with grief and loss , especially when it takes on a very detached approach in some ways with the characters constantly unable to deal with those emotions for the most parts . The movie opened true to Kawase's penchant for capturing moving air . Here , we see lush greenery on tree tops dancing to the motion of wind , and vast open fields where blades of grass sway back and forth when caressed by the breeze . It's like watching a National Geographic episode of forests and greenery before the opening credits kicked in to start the film proper . I even suspected that M Night Shyamalan could have paid homage in his The Happening , which also had plenty of such shots put into it . The story tells of the relationship that formed between Shigeki ( Shigeki Uda ) and Machiko ( Machiko Ono ) , the former an old man in an elderly home who has been aloof after the lost of his wife some 33 years ago . 33 years is an extremely long time , and to miss someone for that long , well , you know how strong his emotions are to his wife . On the other hand , Machiko is a staff at the same elderly home , but she too is grieving internally for the loss of her son , and her husband squarely puts the responsibility and blame on her petite shoulders . While initially starting off on the wrong foot with fiery misunderstanding , they soon hit it off in a game of tag in the great outdoors , where the camera pulls back to reveal again the large open spaces , and the two protagonists finding and connecting with each other , two tiny creatures in the space that Nature offered , only to act as a precursor of a more adventurous outing that would come soon after , in an excursion that took a turn for the unexpected when their car ran into a ditch . In what seemed to be a wandering around aimlessly on foot deep inside nature herself , both Shigeki and Machiko had to depend on each other to keep to their wildlife tour , with the former having the objective of wanting to look for his late wife's grave , like a pilgrimage in itself . The observations from far earlier gives way to a more intimate look at the two , and Shigeki turned into some kind of enigma , clutching his all important haversack , as they go from set piece to set piece , some quaintly quiet , while others I seem to make no headway from sudden outbursts which persisted as being more whiny than anything else . Might be a masterpiece for some to appreciate , especially with its beautiful cinematography , but everything else was certainly lost on me probably due to my lack of extreme patience , and I grief in not being able to be moved by this movie .
462116	2467618	36264	6.0	Meh .	This is a decent Looney Tunes cartoon that somehow managed to be nominated for an Oscar . While this made little sense , there was some justice in life as the wonderful DER FUEHRER'S FACE from Disney took the actual award . I think part of the reason I am less than thrilled with this cartoon is that I couldn't help think of two main problems . One , the 1933 Disney version of the Three Pigs was a much , much better tale - - with better laughs and much better animation . The story here in PIGS IN A POLKA just seemed like a copy . Two , while this is a pleasant cartoon , compared to the other toons being made by Warner Brothers at the time , this is pretty limp . I'd much rather have seen Daffy Duck or the Studio's latest creation , Bugs Bunny , instead of seeing these pigs dancing to Brahms ' " Hungarian Dances " . Overall , good but far from great . If you are looking for it yourself , I suggest you buy the Looney Tunes Golden Collection and avoid the version I saw . I saw it on a DVD entitled " Cartoon Crazys : And The Envelope Please " . This is a rather poor compilation of supposedly award winning and nominated films . Poor because several of the films are very lame and are NOT award nominated , the prints are rather bad and parts of some of the cartoons are missing ! In the case of PIGS IN A POLKA and THE DOVER BOYS cartoons , the entire opening and closing is missing - - and you'd never know they were Looney Tunes cartoons ! While these cartoons both have lapsed into the public domain , clipping the cartoons like this and not acknowledging the people who made this is just plain sleazy .
520763	1162550	68306	3.0	not enough to chew on	Yaphet Kotto is Bone , a bulky black man , ( as well as thief & rapist ) . He appears in the life of Bill ( Andrew Duggan ) & Bernadette ( Joyce Van Patten ) , a seemingly rich white couple . Bone is a hodge-podge of a movie with something social commentary to say . That's not to say it's a bad movie ( it does have shining spots ) , but it's just not a terribly good movie either . Some of it is so dull . Expected quite a bit more from Larry Cohen . That being said , Say what you will about Blue Underground released Dvds , but whatever they choose to put out has amazingly good transfers and extras . DVD Extras : Commentary with Larry Cohen & Bill Lustig ; interview with producer ; 30 minutes of shots from the aborted first shoot ; 2 theatrical trailers ( teaser , and under the name of " housewife " ) ; poster and stills galleryEye Candy : Joyce Van Patten gets topless , as does Jeannie Berlin
574403	4532636	86425	4.0	Pass Me a Barf Bag	Blech ! ! A gloopy soap opera starring Shirley MacLaine and Debra Winger as a contentious mother / daughter duo , whose on-again / off-again relationship culminates in the daughter dying of cancer in one of the most emotionally manipulative plot developments in the history of cinema . Both MacLaine and Winger are too good to waste their talents on this , but it's only because of their wisecracking smart-ass personalities that the film is watchable at all . Jack Nicholson , as a retired astronaut who cozies up to MacLaine , gives us all an inkling of the actor he would eventually turn into , all sarcastic smirking and self-conscious mugging . I especially hate the way this movie looks . It's gauzy and padded , all big hair and bigger shoulder pads . Nothing ever looks like it's completely in focus .
442620	819382	230169	8.0	Deranged	Considered as a film about an unhappy and perverted man , the movie is so-so , perhaps a bit more . A boy and his brother grow up on a dismal farm . Their father is brutal , their mother religious and caring but stern too . Always , when they show weakness , there is the shadow of the allegation of femininity hanging in the background . Older boy leaves home as soon as decorum allows . The father disappears from their lives and the mother , domineering and clinging , takes over Ed Gein's life . She dies painfully . Ed goes mad . Mother appears in hallucinations , telling Ed what to do , scolding him if he hesitates , prompting him to acts most of us might vomit at the mere thought of . But you know what ? This is way , way ahead of the usual sorts of slasher movies , the kind that have turned into self parodies . Railsback was executive producer and cast himself in the principal role , and he's good too , although his mangled Southern mumble is a bit difficult to square with the actual Wisconsin setting of the events . Railsback underplays Gein's psychosis just enough . Gein isn't a loony loner , as he might have been . He's a slow-moving gloomy looking guy who dresses like a sloppy rube ( you can almost smell his unwashed overalls ) but he's reasonable in public , seems to have his wits about him . He makes the right kinds of comments , more or less , at the times they are called for . Overhearing a conversation between a saleswoman and a customer who has heart disease , he wishes her well on her forthcoming operation , a nice gesture that anyone with claims to normality might make . Railsback makes him quiet , slightly awkward , and gives him a constant shy smile in front of others . It's a fine portrayal of schizophrenia , better than Russel Crowe's in " A Beautiful Mind . " Gein is just about perfect , a shambling walk ( almost on tip toe ) , a stare that lasts far too long , the unfunny joke he tells that makes him laugh out loud while others gawk , the half-baked religious ideas , a daily cycle that seems all non sequitur . He gets the necessary chores done , buys antifreeze and goes shopping . Not the way you and I might - - he lives on nothing but canned pork and beans ( and some other things ) - - but he gets the job done . He hangs out from time to time in a depressingly dark rural saloon , where he sits one or two stools away from the few other customers . The others know him , and some , like the bartender , are kind and sympathetic to him , while some make jokes about him . That's his public face . Rather a dull lonely man , a sad man really who has never recovered from his mother's death , someone who needs looking after and will never get it . His home , however - - well , that's a different matter entirely . As a police officer once said about Son of Sam's residence , " the inside of his house looks like the inside of his head . " It's a remote and non-productive place , falling apart on the outside , the lock missing from the front door , old tires and bedsprings in the yard . That's just the outside . The inside is even worse . Horrible , in fact . About the single most depressing dump I can remember seeing on screen in recent years . Little light seems to enter . And what the light shows us we'd rather not see . The man seems never to have thrown out any piece of junk he's come into possession of . Old newspapers stacked in corners . Dirty dishes . An unmade bed that any prison could improve upon . Gein was frankly nuts , no question about it . But , as I understand it , he murdered only two people , both of them middle-aged ladies who treated him in a motherly fashion . Of course the house had body parts all over it but these were from dug-up corpses . The man ate out of bowls made from that part of the skull called the calvarium , and so did his few guests . But naturally he had few guests . He made a few dollars babysitting two boys at his place but when one of them wandered into his bedroom - - the bedroom with the shrunken heads on the walls and the rats on the floor - - he ushered the kids to the door and politely and firmly told them not to come back . " I guess a man needs his privacy , " he tells them . The two murders are horrifying in a non-sensational way . Both women are shot without expecting it to happen . One doesn't die immediately and protests when her punctured body is dragged out to Gein's truck to be taken to his cellar and dressed like a hog . But , although the scenes are graphic and realistic , they are not at all sensationalized . No preliminary threats , no bondage or torture , no screaming , no maniacal whacking with axes or bashing in of heads with maces . It's all the more frightening for its matter-of-fact tone . And there is one scene in which Gein , a raving lunatic , dances out of his front door into the moonlight , dressed in long johns and human skin , a merkin fixed to his groin , banging pots and pans and whooping with God only knows what rotten pot of exaltations . It's far more shocking than anything in " Henry : Portrait of a Serial Killer , " although the two have the senselessness of random murders in common . You want to be scared ? This true story , this production , ought to do the job . You'll be locking your doors at night .
559318	2626332	120877	9.0	Woods at his absolute best . Carpenter's still got " it . "	PREMISEThe quest for the black cross is on . When the Vatican learns that a nest of vampires is after this holy relic , they send Jack Crow ( Woods ) and his team of expert vampire hunters out to find it first . If the vampires get their hands on it , they can then do a rite which will enable them to walk in sunlight and go virtually undetected . END PREMISEWhile this movie received horrible ratings among fans of the vampire genre , it is a clever twist on the old story with enough variations to make it great . I have not always liked Carpenter's work , but this one is up there with his older classics , in my opinion . I think the reason it was not well received is that movie audiences of today , especially American movie audiences , have become more jaded and desensitized to the effects of horror . After all , what makes horror , true horror , to you ? Is it more blood ? More graphic scenes showing disemboweled corpses in detail ? The true psychological mind game ? Ghosts ? Monsters ? What ? That question is answered differently by every person you ask . Therefore no horror movie , especially a specific genre of horror movie , will satisfy every fan of that genre . Vampire fans , in particular , are discriminating creatures who demand a certain level of story quality , effects quality , and believability . Otherwise , they will turn on the makers like a pack of rabid wolves . There are rules which must be followed , or the movie loses its flavor for these discriminating and sometimes sophisticated palettes . Carpenter broke the rules in this endeavor , and the lack of its success embodies the fans ' contempt for his lack of respect for the main principles of vampirism . Guns were far too widely used here . They were much better utilized in Len Wiseman's " Underworld , " in which unique bullets were used . I won't go into the details so as not to spoil that movie for anyone who has yet to see that pure work of art . Click my name to see my review of it . I liked the plot , and I found this movie very enjoyable . I , however , am not the discriminating vampire fan . I highly enjoyed " Lost Boys , " although , I would not recommend it to another fan of that specific genre due to its mainstream-ality . Honestly , there are very few vampire movies out there which live up the the rigid expectations of the true vampire fan . This movie is one of those movies I would recommend , merely because , while it violates some of the basic rules behind vampirism and is not what I would classify as an intelligent vampire film , it still has a few redeeming qualities . These vampires have an agenda . They are on a mission . They do not simply kill to feed . They are after the " black cross " in order to liberate their species from the prison of darkness , and will kill anyone in their way . There are some suspenseful scenes , and this movie does carry a degree of intensity , but it was otherwise a bit disappointing for the true vampire fan . While the Master Vampire in this endeavor is purported to be the original vampire , his demonstrations of vampire craft are not very impressive . According to legend ( those rules I mentioned earlier ) , older vampires are accorded specific powers which young vampires are not . While he does demonstrate the legendary feats of strength , that is where it stops . That in itself , was quite disappointing . The potential was here , and as I said , there are some great elements , but this movie fails miserably to live up to its expectations and potential . My honest recommendations for good vampire movies would be " Underworld , " " Dusk Til Dawn , " " Salem's Lot " ( the made for TV movie , and not the butchered video release . . . beware ! ) , and " Near Dark , " one of the best , in my opinion . I ( being a romantic ) loved " Interview with a Vampire , " regardless of the hidden subtext and omitted story lines , but that is my personal choice . Fans of Anne Rice's " Vampire Chronicles " for the most part hated that movie , for those reasons , and others , I'm sure , and her " Queen of the Damned " was completely bastardized on film , so I'll stand by the movies I've already named here , with " Underworld at the top of the list . I found that movie to be - extremely - good . I judged " Underworld " harder than most , because of the high expectations I had for that movie . I was not disappointed . If you are a fan of horror and / or vampire / werewolf lore , check it out . It's going to be a classic , one day . This movie rates a with few slow spots and lots of heavy , fast-paced action . the Fiend : .
518981	8239592	74419	8.0	A hilariously horrible and hence enjoyable howler of a 70's killer animal horror flick	The 70's revolt-of-nature fright film craze reaches its uproariously abysmal apex with this gloriously ghastly , yet often funny and hence strangely enjoyable stinker . For reasons which are never completely clarified the numerous assorted canines in a sleepy armpit California college hamlet join into one huge vicious pack and start turning on wholly deserving personality-less homo sapien drips with heartwarming bloodthirsty panache . David McCallum of " The Man from U . N . C . L . E .

Harlan is such a grossly unlikable and unappealing jerk that the more cheerfully misanthropic viewers out there can easily root for the murderous mutts with a clear conscience . Boasting such tried'n'true endearingly awful bad movie ingredients as all-thumbs direction , zero suspense , ugly , poorly lit , barely watchable nighttime cinematography , gory , but way bogus make-up f / x , uniformly insipid'n'atrocious acting from the entire cast ( Mel Brooks feature regular George Wyner cops the thespic booby prize as a nerdy fellow biology professor ) , seriously uninvolving toothpick lean characters , and plenty of horrendously botched animal attack scenes ( a little old lady gets mangled by a Doberman after the dobie tears apart a biker , a pre - " Dallas " Linda Gray gets chomped in the shower in a gut-busting homage to " Psycho , " an obnoxious curly-haired fat slob crashes through a glass door in show-stopping slow motion , and so on ) , this stunningly shoddy schlocker overall sizes up as one hopelessly lame puppy .

407218	865972	804552	9.0	Very dark and ugly thriller .	When the corpses of a gangster and his pregnant crack whore girlfriend surface-he brutally mutilated , she electrocuted-it remains a mystery why ' WAZ ' was carved into the girl's belly after her death and when a second pair of bodies is found , one of them marked with the same cryptic letters , the hunt for a serial killer begins . The cynic cop played by Stellan Skarsgard tries to find the tormented serial killer . . . " W Delta Z " aka " WAZ " is so bleak , hopeless and utterly dark that it's almost suffocating . Its theme of moral emptiness and the scenes of graphic torture will no doubt upset some unprepared viewers . The film is shot almost entirely at night by Morten Søborg of " Pusher " fame . The script by Clive Bradley is intelligent with its central theme of non-existence of altruism and is completely devoid of any light . I simply can't wait for Tom Shankland's bleak survival horror " The Day " ( 2008 ) . Finally I live for such gritty and ugly cinema like " WAZ " .

573917	4532636	36342	8.0	When Hitchcock Comes to Middle America	It's been reported that the primary appeal of doing " Shadow of a Doubt " for Alfred Hitchcock was the idea of bringing a sense of menace to a small , every day American town . In that , this movie brilliantly succeeds . It doesn't join " Rear Window " or " Psycho " as one of my favorite Hitchcock films , but it has much to recommend it . Joseph Cotten didn't get many chances to play a sinister villain , but he's very good at it . His natural ease and charm work to his advantage in creating a smarmy character who you're never completely sure about . He has a lot of chemistry with Teresa Wright , who plays his niece and supposedly has a closer than normal connection with him . In fact , in typical Hitchcock fashion , their relationship in the early scenes of this film takes on a sort of creepy romantic quality that's never overtly addressed but is always there as subtext . As Wright begins to suspect that her Uncle Charlie might not be such a great guy after all - - and may in fact be much worse than simply not a great guy - - the balance of power shifts and she begins to play against him . One of the things I liked most about this movie was how strong a character Wright's Charlie is allowed to be . She's not a ninny , like a character in her situation would be in any number of other films . She doesn't swoon , cry and squeal helplessly . After Uncle Charlie tries to kill her by locking her in a garage with a running car , and she comes to looking directly into his face , she doesn't bite her knuckles as you might expect , but rather says with a cold hard determination , " Go away . " It's very effective , and the whole movie is like that . It has a great supporting cast , both well cast and acted . There's not a throwaway character among the bunch , and everyone makes much of varying sized roles . Patricia Collinge is a stand out as Uncle Charlie's sister , whose radar is going off even as she doesn't want to believe anything sinister can be happening . Henry Travers is the father of the family . . . his attitudes toward Charlie change after he comes to the bank where he works and makes inappropriate jokes . It wasn't until the end credits that I even realized who Hume Cronyn was playing ; I've never seen him so young . " Shadow of a Doubt " isn't as obviously distinguished visually as other Hitchcock films , but it bears his unmistakable mark nonetheless . There aren't as many shots you come away from the film remembering as there are in , say , " Rear Window . " But the whole thing has the feeling of being completely controlled from beginning to end . I really liked the way small-town America was portrayed in this film . It's not full of a bunch of rubes who say things like " aw shucks " and do silly things for us to laugh at . Hitchcock is skillful at showing the contrast between the small-town life of young Charlie's family and Uncle Charlie's jaded big-city life of crime . But he doesn't condescend or patronize . If you want to see higher-tier Hitchcock , you could do much worse than this film . It's got an engaging story , wonderful acting and complex characters , and a few scenes that qualify as genuine nail biters . Very good !
438256	306861	22153	10.0	Barbara Stanwyck Scores In Fascinating Film	A blind man hopes , in all humility , to serve a famous female evangelist in her ministry , but soon he finds himself falling in love with THE MIRACLE WOMAN . Columbia Pictures , and young director Frank Capra , had to walk a fine line between the sacred and the profane in this topical feature , and ended up with a solid piece of entertainment . Good production values only serve to underscore the excellent acting in the two leading roles . A balance is maintained between sanctity , sanctimoniousness & sentiment . Contemporary viewers , whether churched or not , should find material here to interest them . It is a shame this fine film has become so obscure . Barbara Stanwyck dominates & fascinates in the title role , never slipping into caricature or allowing her character to become cardboard . She presents a well rounded portrait of a complicated , lonely female who experiences the pangs & joys of unexpected love . She is careful , though , to keep her portrayal sympathetic - realizing that her character was not entirely fictional - but she is never dull . In fact , watching Stanwyck give an impassioned exhortation from inside a lions ' cage has got to be one of the more unique scenes from any film of the 1930's . As the blind former aviator , David Manners gives one of the finest performances of his career , deftly underplaying his role , while letting just enough of the character's angst show through . He gives us the portrait of a man who doesn't need his eyesight to be a moral hero . Plump little Beryl Mercer scores as Manners ' cheery landlady . Sam Hardy is most convincing as Stanwyck's crooked manager . Charles Middleton portrays a hardhearted Deacon early in the film . Stanwyck's character in THE MIRACLE WOMAN is heavily based on the most famous & beloved female evangelist of all time , Aimee Semple McPherson . At the height of her popularity , there was not a movie star in Hollywood who could rival her celebrity . Born Aimee Elizabeth Kennedy on October 9 , 1890 in Ontario , Canada , Sister Aimee was the daughter of a Methodist farmer & a Salvation Army worker mother . Completely uninterested in spiritual things as a girl , this changed when she met & romanced dynamic young Pentecostal missionary Robert Semple . In 1908 she gave her life to both God & Robert and married and moved with him to the British Crown Colony of Hong Kong . They both became very ill in China and upon his death from malaria in 1910 , his widow relocated to New York City with their infant daughter , Roberta . In 1912 Sister Aimee married Rhode Island grocery salesman Harold McPherson , but she warned him that the call of God was on her life and if she felt the need to preach , she would have to leave him . Harold agreed , but the marriage didn't last her entry into the revival circuit ( a future third marriage also ended in divorce ) . News of her preaching spread from town to town , and soon Sister Aimee was in demand as an evangelistic speaker . With Roberta & baby son Rolf , she toured in her Gospel Car and became perhaps the first woman to solo drive from coast to coast . In 1918 Sister Aimee settled in Los Angeles , California , and it remained her headquarters city for the rest of her life . Physically striking as well as intelligent , Sister Aimee was a forceful , charismatic speaker and it did not take her long to gather a large & loyal body of adherents . She built the magnificent Angelus Temple in 1923 , and there in its 5 , 300 seat auditorium she would present her lavish illustrated sermons before the spellbound eyes of her congregation . In 1924 Sister Aimee became the first female to operate her own radio station , which she bought for $25 , 000 . Speaking or broadcasting 22 times a week , and never charging admission , Sister Aimee beat the movies at their own game with her highly entertaining & theatrical services . Stars such as Douglas Fairbanks & Charlie Chaplin regularly attended to marvel at her stage presence . It is hardly surprising that controversy and even scandal followed such a notable individual . Indeed , at one time she was the subject of 45 separate legal suits . But it is the mystery surrounding her disappearance in 1926 that continues to encourage speculation : while swimming in the Pacific Ocean on May 18 , Sister Aimee vanished . The nation mourned her apparent drowning . Thousands converged on the beach at Santa Monica ; one diver died & a female follower committed suicide , claiming she wanted to accompany Sister Aimee to Heaven . But then mysterious ransom notes began appearing at Angelus Temple and the complexion of the story began to change . Finally , on June 23 , Sister Aimee suddenly reappeared in Douglas , Arizona , telling a tale of kidnapping & miraculous escape . She said she had been approached on the beach by a distraught couple , desperately wanting her to come pray for their dying child . She was whisked away in a waiting car , but ended up across the border in Mexico , where she was kept tied in a shack and tortured with burning cigarettes . Biding her time , she waited until she was alone , rolled off her cot and cut her bonds on the edge of a metal can lid . Then she stumbled into the Mexican village of Agua Prieta , where she was able to get a taxi to Douglas . This was her story . 50 , 000 people met her train when it arrived from Arizona . The faithful adored her all the more , but her enemies whispered about a possible love tryst . The Los Angeles District Attorney charged her before the Grand Jury for corruption of morals by staging a hoax . However , her story could never be proven or disproved , and the perjury case was dismissed for lack of evidence . But who would want her kidnapped ? A possible solution is this : Born again bootleggers would broadcast their testimonies at Sister Aimee's radio station , naming the corrupt officials who helped them . This could prove disastrous to any number of men in high positions of authority , and giving Sister Aimee a solid scare might remedy their problem . What is known for sure is that the District Attorney who persecuted her was later imprisoned himself at San Quentin for bribery . Sister Aimee came and prayed for him . Rebounding stronger than ever , Sister Aimee incorporated the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel in 1927 , based on the tenets of belief of Jesus Christ as Savior , Baptizer , Healer , and Soon-Coming King . During the 1930's , Sister Aimee was at the height of her influence and fame . In addition to her church services , touring revival crusades and radio station , she operated a Bible school , edited a magazine , wrote books , composed stirring songs and oversaw her denomination of 200 churches . Her healing ministry came in for much scrutiny , but no one has ever proven that it was faked or phony . Sister Aimee , who spent as long as eight hours after services praying for the sick , was quick to give all the glory to God . And there were undeniable positive results : folks who arrived in ambulances returned home on streetcars . Sister Aimee's death in Oakland , California , on September 27 , 1944 , was the tragic result of an accidental overdose of sleeping pills . After the funeral in the Angelus Temple , 35 , 000 mourners passed by her grave in Forest Lawn Cemetery . Her son , Rolf McPherson , assumed leadership of The Foursquare Denomination , which is still strong & vibrant today . While her lavish lifestyle and oversized personality made Sister Aimee an easy mark for ridicule and even spoofery , it should not be forgotten that she provided hope & comfort to millions of desperate Americans during the darkest days of the Great Depression . That's not a bad legacy .
402903	453228	57076	5.0	Done on a higher budget than Dr No	This film is done on a higher budget than Dr No , but did not have the blank check as the future Bond films received . It's a bit dated , and introduces characters for future Bond films . It introduces the Bond gagets , but they are lame compared to the newer films . The beginning is excellent , but like in a lot of old films , the story drags trying to over explain itself . Robert Shaw plays a good character , and introduces the watch strangler gismo . The viewer is introduced to Specter , the criminal organization which is involved in the early Bond trilogy .
422747	2248099	67511	4.0	One of the most boring Giallo's ever made !	Everything I'd read about this film prior to seeing it pointed to it being rubbish , but after reading the plot description ; I figured that it might actually be OK . However , I was wrong . The plot sounds like Cold Eyes of Fear could be a gritty cross between the Giallo and the slew of ' house ' films ( e . g . House on the Edge of the Park , The Last House on the Beach ) whereby criminal ( s ) take innocents hostage inside their home . It sort of is a cross between these genres ; but it's so damned boring that any positives that may have come from this are instantly sucked away . The film takes place in London , which is unfortunate as it means that we're ' treated ' to a load of phoney British accents . It really annoys me that some people actually think we talk like this ! Anyway , the plot focuses on Peter ; a young man who picks up an Italian hooker and takes her back to his place . However , they arrive to find a criminal in wait for them . Peter's father , a judge , then sends a copper to sort the situation ; but the man who turns up is an impostor , hell-bent on revenge . . . The film actually gets off to a good start . . . but that then turns out to be a stage show , and that pretty much sums the entire film up . Other directors have proved many times that the Giallo can be wholly entertaining , despite the often rubbish plots ; but Castellari shows here that they can be really boring too ! It's a shame really , as the director has proved himself to me with a trio of great crime films ( The Big Racket , Street Law and The Heroin Busters ) , as well as one of the best Jaws rip offs in the form of The Last Shark - but the man obviously can't handle Giallo . It's strange that a man with such a penchant for violent action would make a film so boring , and perhaps one of the reason why it is so boring is that a lot of the main ' action ' focuses on talking , and Castellari is obviously better suited to shooting car chases and fist fights . The acting is as crap as you would expect , and this isn't helped at all by the awful dubbing . Not even Morricone's score is up to much . Overall , don't bother with this one - there are FAR better Giallo's out there !
428615	3079504	1142798	7.0	Typical Tyler Perry drama is helped by two sterling leads in Bates and Woodard	The friendship between " rich " white Kathy Bates and " poor " black Alfre Woodard and the turmoil that occurs in their families is the fodder for the latest film from Tyler Perry . Pure potboiler its the sort of movie that hits every note you expect , especially if you've seen any number of Tyler Perry's earlier films . Its a solidly good film with some magical moments , Woodard and Bates make a wonderful on screen duo and I would love to see another pairing of them . If there is a flaw its that the script is pure potboiler . There is nothing wrong with that but I bit more reality could have made this into Perry's best film . Note to Tyler Perry : You are easily one of the best directors working today . Get away from the potboiler feel good chick flicks and do something else . Oscar is calling .
423928	2248099	82966	6.0	Fulci's Haunted House	The plot of House by the Cemetery follows the story of a young family that move into an old house that used to be occupied by a mad doctor , Dr Freudstein . The only trouble is , that Freudstein hasn't moved out , and he's currently hiding in the basement in the house and committing grisly murders on whomever dares to stay there . . . House by the Cemetery is Lucio Fulci's take on the haunted house genre ; but obviously , since it's Fulci , this film is much more gory than your average haunted house horror . The film was actually praised by the BBFC for its restraint , but it still features beheading , throat ripping , a bat attack , impaling , a knife through the head and several other gory set pieces . However , despite this ; the film is rather slow to build up , in fact , after the initial gory opener ; the film doesn't really get going again for about an hour , and although once it does getting going it is pretty good , during the build up to it , it's not so good . And that's not good because the build up takes up the majority of the movie . House by the cemetery also features one of the most hideous children that I've ever seen in a movie ; Giovanni Frezza . He would later appear in the excellent Lamberto Bava films , " A Blade in the Dark " and " Demons " , but he's got a lot more screentime in this movie , and he is , therefore , much more annoying . It's a shame that his character is so hard to identify with due to him being so annoying because Fulci creates most of the tension in the movie from this kid , but because he's so irritating , I almost guarantee that you'll be cheering for Freudstein . The film also features Katherine MacColl , one of Fulci's favourite actresses , and a lady he also cast in two of his other gorefests ; The Beyond and City of the Living Dead . Katherine is most definitely the best actor of the movie , and she's also very beautiful , so it's not hard to see why Fulci would continue to cast her . The film also features Paolo Malco , who would later appear in The New York Ripper and Ania Pieroni , whom horror fans will recognise from the Dario Argento masterpieces " Tenebrae " and " Inferno " . The acting is not great in this movie , but Italian horror films aren't known for their great exhibitions of acting , so it doesn't matter . The villain of the piece ; Dr Freudstein is said to be one of Fulci's most famous zombies , but this is probably more down to the fact that the others are mostly the same as each other , whereas Freudstein is different . The creature itself is very disgusting and makes for a great baddie though , so I'll give Fulci credit for that . My only criticism of it would be that the monster doesn't get a lot of screentime , which is a shame . Overall , House by the Cemetery is not Fulci's best work , but it's an interesting film with a few redeeming features . Fulci fans should like it .
504530	2911571	1258202	7.0	" Did ya get me sinners and hippies ? "	I guess you could say that in the look and feel of " Long Pig " that it's either very low budget ( it is ) or it's an attempt to capture the same sort of look as Texas Chainsaw Massacre . Either way , that part works . We have several different stories going on that all eventually converge in an isolated barn where the nastiness takes place , for the most part . It's not pretty but I've seen worse . We have a young woman who is going in search of her environmentalist brother , who disappeared with several of his colleagues after they chained themselves to " old-growth " trees to prevent them being cut down to put in more power lines . We have three nerdy guys ( one wearing a t-shirt that says " Uwe Boll Ate My Dingo " ! ) that are conspiring to crash a frat party with lots of babes & lots of beer . And , we have the frat boys & sorority girls who want nothing more than to get drunk & screw . And one young woman who is devastated by her recent break-up with her boyfriend . Unfortunately for all of them , none of their little troubles seem to matter much when they find themselves in an isolated area with masked killers stalking their every moves . Once these young folks are captured , they're not merely slaughtered , they're put through the torture of sharing some of their deepest , darkest secrets first , and not necessarily about just themselves . There's something about a creepy and crazy man with long white hair , who comes off as sort of a preacher or something , and if you need a protagonist to replace " Leatherface " from TCM , it's this guy . He stalks one young woman in the barn with a chainsaw on a long handle until he connects . Piggy , where are you ? Very creepy stuff . There's also some scenes of some well-dressed and greedy old man , just waiting to sink his teeth into some long pig , which is pretty nasty . There's also a strange white pyramid-type building with a cross ( which is a window ) on the side , which left me a bit puzzled but I guess is an alternate entrance to the barn structure . I find it really hard to do this film justice in writing , because while I thought it was fairly well done for an independent effort , it's also fairly complicated at times & you really need to just watch it , if you're interested . There is certainly the implication " long pig " is being packaged and transported outside of that area , and there are also seemingly connections between the long-haired preacher man & various US Presidents . . . yow . Anyway , it's a creep-fest , and it's nasty , and it's about cannibalism , so if that appeals to you , then by all means check it out . Perhaps someone else can explain this all better than I . .
504703	2911571	89562	3.0	are you kidding me ?	Yeah , OK , this may be deliberately cheesy but it's all pretty lousy , and not in a good way . We have a brave " bone hunter " in search of Dinosaur Valley but all the poor guy can find is bad action / adventure movie clichés , like people sinking in quicksand , nude natives , plane crashes , Viet Nam vets , and knock-down drag out fights in piranha infested waters while bleeding . I hope this was intended as a parody because if it wasn't it succeeded pretty well , unintentionally , anyway . There are a couple of nice ladies to look at but beyond that it's all pretty far fetched stuff that manages to be somewhat entertaining but wears thin after a while . There's a bit of cannibal & head-hunter stuff , a bit of lesbian stuff , but the rest is pretty much by-the-numbers action adventure stuff and I'm actually truly sorry I wasted my time on this . Not a fine example of 80's film making & certainly not what I'd refer to as a horror film . . . . . .
574250	4532636	183649	7.0	Hell Has Officially Frozen Over - - A Joel Schumacher Film I Don't Hate	No one wanted to hate " Phone Booth " more than me , since I absolutely despise Joel Schumacher and almost every movie he's ever made . I've actually taken the trouble to think about who my least favorite director of all time is , and Schumacher won the booby prize . So blame it on my incredibly low expectations , but I really liked this movie . I agree with the other people here that the script is weak . No effort is made to develop characters - - it seems as if the screenwriter began to add dimension to Forest Whitaker's cop and then thought better of it . But do you really want a lot of script in a movie like this ? The film makers were wise to keep the running time to a swift 80 minutes , and while I didn't think they were especially clever in the set up or execution , it was competent enough to hold my interest . I was pleasantly surprised by Colin Farrell's performance . He's great , and does much more with what he's given than the material probably warrants . I watched this by myself , but was still slightly embarrassed to find myself moved by his speech in which he confesses all of his sins to the assembled crowd . Even as I'm writing this review , I can't believe I didn't find this display hokier , but I guess I was in the right mood at the time . This movie reminded me of the kind of " B " thriller they might have made in the 40's - - slick , quick and not especially intended to impress . Frequently , because those films aimed low , they scored high , as does " Phone Booth " for me .
485529	1416505	21814	9.0	Stylish horror classic .	Along with " Alien " this is the most stylish horror movie I have ever seen . This version of Dracula is different from others since this movie is based on a play . There are still some surprises and interesting elements even if you have seen some of the other many Dracula movies that has been made and in many ways this movie is better then all the other Dracula movies . One of the reasons why is the cast . Bela Lugosi with his crazy accent puts quite some passion in his role and Dwight Frye is simply amazing as Renfield . But the rest of the cast is also more than excellent . The acting is different from other movies made at the time , the acting can be described as timeless and even after more than 70 years it is still not outdated . But there are of course many other things that are outdated . Such as especially the special effects of course . An interesting element in this movie was the gentlemen battle between Dracula and Van Helsing . There was really some chemistry in the scene's between those two and there was a real tension without them both fighting eachother . There was a really nice moody atmosphere that was very stylish . The great sets and locations contributed to this . But also the cinematography was wonderful and I especially like the way they filmed the character of count Dracula it was done really well ! But of course an old movie like this is far from flawless . At times there are some serious pacing problems and it was a bit weird to see Renfield walk around freely in the house most of the time and there are dozens of more tiny things like this that makes the movie far from perfect . Still there are lot of things that compensate this and make this movie a real horror classic and a must see . Still after many years of movie making the best Dracula movie ever made and the movie leaves no question about it that Bela Lugosi is and always will be the one and only Dracula as much as I love Christopher Lee as Dracula . . .
510078	453068	52832	8.0	neither Williams , Lumet , or Brando's best , but it's still pretty damn good !	The Fugitive Kind is a hot story of desire and loss and craving and heartbreak between a man and two women set in the deep south . Sounds like quintessential Tenessee Williams , and it is in spurts . Sometimes Williams leans towards being a little preachy , however true ( little moments like when Brando and Stapleton have a quiet back and forth about racism via her painting kind of nails it on the head much ) , but it's his skills at doing melodrama that strike up the coolest beats . In fact , this is one of those super-cool movies of the late 50s that could have only starred someone like Brando , who looks at times disinterested in the scene but at the same time completely engaged , curious , smooth , harsh , and knowing of what life can bring with his trusty Ledbelly-signed guitar . It's not necessarily a towering work for the ages ala Williams collaboration 1 Streetcar Named Desire . But that doesn't mean it should be much under-looked either . As an early effort for Lumet it's also a scorcher dramatically ; he's so good with the actors that whatever little missteps the script might take in pouring on the poetic prose in how some of the characters talk ( there's a scene between Brando and Anna Magnani's characters by some ruin of a spot where she says people used to make love that is actually quite boring ) can be usually forgiven . Magnani especially is interesting because she should be a case of miscasting , which , apparently in later years , Lumet admitted to . She seems low-key at first , but her strengths bloom out tenfold when it comes time to act like the hard-knock-life kind of woman she is , who's in a crap marriage and had a horrible affair with a man who didn't do anything after the summer they spent together . Now she's put into a situation where she does and doesn't want this drifter , and vice versa , and she's sometimes just as cool ( though also quite tough and demanding in that big Italian mama way ) as her counterpart . Meanwhile there's also Joanne Woodard , who has the kind of part many actresses love to chew on ; feisty , outspoken , loud but also emotionally moody to the point that she admirably tries ( and doesn't quite get to ) the heights of Vivien Leigh with her classic Blanche Dubois . Overall , Lumet gets a good feel for the period - and shot in New York state no less - while working with good material and an even better cast . It won't ever be as revered as his other work , and at the same time it's much better than some would give it credit for , where the tragedy acts like another sweaty Southern caricature bemoaning existence and fitting on a bad pair of shoes .
422921	2248099	113253	3.0	Complete waste of time	Halloween 6 was the only Halloween film I hadn't seen ( before I watched it ) , which means that I've now completely wasted my time on no less than eight Halloween films . Given that each film has an approximate running time of ninety minutes , that means I have wasted 12 hours of my time on this rubbish , which of course , amounts to half a day . I feel sick . Quite why I worked my way through a series that I don't like is anyone's guess , but anyway . . . let's get on to reviewing this film . In fairness , at least Halloween 6 tries to do something a bit different than the usual slash-fest . It fails to create anything interesting , but the fact that it tried is admirable . We follow the birth of Michael's child by his niece ( ? ! ) Jamie Lloyd . The film harks back to the original by throwing in series stalwart Dr Loomis again , as well as some boy named Tommy , who was apparently the kid that was being babysat by Michael's sister in the first film . The film introduces the largely unoriginal idea of a cult worshipping Myers , but the real crux of the story follows the idea that maybe Michael isn't solely responsible for his actions . Michael Myers has always been a rampant and really rather dull man with a knife , but The Curse of Michael Myers attempts to give him a little backbone by way of the idea that maybe he was possessed by demons that made him kill his sister and all those other people . This is obviously just an attempt to inject some life into a very much dead series . It fails because there's barely any interest generated . Scriptwriter Daniel Farrands tries to create some mystery and intrigue , but personally I just didn't care . The main reason why many people find Michael Myers frightening is for the fact that he is cold , completely insane and relentless , so the idea of his actions not being his fault is as stupid and needless as a sixth instalment of the Halloween series . The acting is typically rubbish , with the only standout being Donald Pleasance , who chews the scenery once again in his ( unfortunately ) most famous role . Pleasance died before this film was released , and in my opinion it's a shame that he wasted so much of his time in the Dr Loomis role . After seeing his early performances in films like Cul-De-Sac and The Flesh and the Fiends , it's obvious that Pleasance was a talented actor who is better than films like this . I don't know what Halloween fans would make of this movie and I don't care . To be honest , I'm too upset about the fact that I've wasted half a day on these films .
464481	2467618	1369604	7.0	Wow . . . these other reviews were brutal !	This film was made completely without dialog or narration . It's a tale about some possum-like creatures who inhabit a non-industrialized world . This idyllic world is shattered by a massive city that is much like the oppressively dark one from the film BRAZIL . Slowly , the life of the creatures becomes worse and worse and worse due to pollution and over - industrialization - leading you to wonder if there is there any hope ? Wow , were the other two reviews for VARMINTS brutal ! ! While I would agree that the film was far from subtle and suffers from an overly simplistic " industrialization is bad " message , giving the film a one or two is just mean ! After all , even if you don't like the story , any reasonable person would admit that the CGI is lovely and the music quite evocative . While few films can come close to equaling the quality of Pixar or Dreamworks , this film manages to come awfully close and the art work is very engrossing . In fact , the film is good enough to have earned the Oscar nomination instead of just the " commended " status like it did . Now I am NOT saying that it's as good as many of the nominees , but it certainly was better than at least one or two of them purely from a technical standpoint . Sure , the message was far from subtle and too preachy , but you can't just write off a film because of this - - there is far more to this film than that .
519235	8239592	417148	9.0	A great deal of wildly tongue-in-cheek fun	Easygoing surfer Sean Jones ( a likable portrayal by Nathan Phillips ) witnesses a mob hit and agrees to testify in court against the gangster who committed said hit . The mob tries to bump off Sean prior to the trial by unleashing a plethora of lethal poisonous snakes on board the plane Sean's on . It's to up super smooth FBI agent Neville Flynn ( splendidly played with cool self-assurance by Samuel L . Jackson ) to protect Sean and all the other passengers on board the plane . Director David R . Ellis and screenwriters John Heffernan and Sebastian Gutierrez fortunately don't take the gloriously ludicrous premise with total seriousness ; instead they treat the story with a deliciously knowing sense of self-parodic humor that keeps things appropriately swift , funny , and exciting throughout . The snake attack sequences are every bit as brutal and gruesome as they ought to be ; nasty highlights include an amorous young couple being killed while doing just what you think and one poor guy getting bitten right where it hurts most ( ouch ! ) . Moreover , Ellis adeptly develops a tremendous amount of gripping suspense and maintains a furiously brisk pace throughout . The passengers are an engagingly colorful bunch : Julianna Phlllips as the plucky Claire Miller , Sunny Mabrey as the perky Tiffany , Bruce James as the affable Ken , and Lin Shayne as the brave Grace are the flight attendants , plus there's high strung rap star Three G's ( an amusingly neurotic Flex Alexander ) and his bodyguards Troy ( lovable lug Kenan Thompson ) and Big Leroy ( burly Keith Dallas ) , two little boys , cheery rich bimbo Mercedes ( lovely blonde sprite Rachel Blanchard ) , a newlywed couple , and arrogant British snob Paul ( a perfectly hateful'n'haughty Gerald Plunkett ) . Adding to the already infectiously crazed merriment is the highly lively and inspired mix of elements from the action , horror , comedy , and disaster genres . Granted , the animated CGI snakes are pretty hokey , but that only adds to the considerable wacky charm . Okay , we're not talking Oscar-worthy cinematic masterpiece here , but this much-hyped flick certainly delivers the promised hugely enjoyable over-the-top goods with a heady blast of sheer galvanizing go-for-it joy and energy that's impossible to either dislike or resist . A real rip-roaring pip .
482588	1293485	243736	6.0	Although I didn't take a liking to the ending , it was a decent movie	" 40 days and 40 nights " is about a guy who vows that he will remain " untouched " for Lent . 40 days and 40 nights of him not touching a girl or himself to push the vow to go a little further . Seems easy , right ? Oh , wait ! I forgot , Josh Hartnett is the guy ! That's what makes the movie so ridiculous . But you kind of get into it . It's kind of ironic , because Josh is a cutie that all the girls love , and you can't imagine a guy like him would make a vow like that . You'd think they would cast maybe a nerd or something . : P Just kidding . I thought the movie was actually pretty good . It has some very funny moments and sexy ones as well . I would recommend for the weekend if you have nothing better to do . I just didn't like the ending too well , but you have to judge for yourself .
434473	2171244	82559	4.0	Another Night of the Living Dead ?	" Virus " is the original Italian title of this video nastie , which was one of the infamous 74 banned in Britain as " Zombie Creeping Flesh , " and released in 2002 without any cuts . It is also known as as " Zombie 2 " , " Night Of The Zombies " and " Hell Of The Living Dead . " A chemical plant in the jungle releases a poison gas and turns all the employees into zombies . It spreads to the countryside infecting the natives . ( For history on chemical plants in the third world and the culpability of colonial powers google Union Carbide and Bhopal ) . We join the worst SWAT team in the World as they are assigned to do something - I'm not sure what . They pick up Lia ( Margit Evelyn Newton ) and her cameraman as their companions are killed by zombies . The only titillating shot comes as they approach a native village and Lia takes off her top and goes native to approach the tribe . One would expect some hoot and crude remarks from the SWAT team here , but they are strangely silent . Some of the grossest scenes occur in the village . It is not for the timid viewer . They battle zombies on the way to the river and her is where we see that one member of the SWAT team is certifiably nuts . We see another member go bonkers in a house they are investigating as he dons a tutu and top hat to search for zombies . But at least nutso knows how to kill zombies . The rest of the team just keeps shooting their bodies even after they see the only way is a head shot . They finally arrive at the plant and I still don't know what they are supposed to do , as they brought no equipment . Lia's eyes bug out at the scene and she is strangely silent after screaming at the top of her lungs . What could have happened ? Gross overacting and stock footage to set the location marred what could have been more than a remake of Night of the Living Dead .

Christopher Neame was given an excellent role which was absolutely awesome . His looks was scary and his voice very dark ! The score is great and Hellbound is a very good film . Neame is an incredible actor and I hope everyone that is a fan of his , Chuck Norris , action , and the horror genre gets to see this !
504483	2911571	129797	6.0	obscure Florida vampire flick	Vampires , in Florida ? Well , it is Jacksonville , so almost not really even Florida . This story concerns the curse of the De Lorca family , which has something to do with the occult and vampires , and apparently rounding up a few young ladies to lure back to the ancestral mansion is a good way to make sure that curse is carried on , because one must bear a child , apparently . Beyond that I was quite lost , actually , because this has a high level of incoherence but is still someone interesting to watch despite its flaws . There's also a fortune teller , and some beast from the beyond , which sort of looks like a cross between a werewolf and an ape . That must be the occult part , because it doesn't seem very much in the vampire vein ( so to speak ) . Anyway , for a no-budget film with a no-name cast it's not totally abysmal , but it's not exactly top-notch either . Just another low-budget 70's obscurity that's worth at least a look , if not for the scares , at least for the " huh ? " value . .
576554	1399158	144667	7.0	VIP : MY BROTHER SUPERMAN ( Bruno Bozzetto , 1968 )	The unprecedented success of Bozzetto's WEST AND SODA ensured a more ambitious follow-up with the aid of American financiers . Biting the hand that fed him ( Bozzetto had primarily been involved in making animated commercials ) , he came up with a sharply satirical narrative about the perils inherent in incessant commercial spoon-feeding to Italian TV audiences . Supervip is the latest in a long line of strapping superheroes while Minivip is his inept ' accidental ' twin brother ; the latter ? short , bespectacled and saddled with an inferiority complex ? is a splendid caricature of Woody Allen . During a psychiatrist-imposed vacation , the latter stumbles onto a massive brainwashing conspiracy instigated by Happy Betty , the head of a chain of supermarkets , intent on controlling the worldwide market through missiles lodged into her customers ' brain that turn them into compulsive buyers ! Every superhero has to have a sweetheart : the intrepid red-headed Lisa is Supervip's girl while the diminutive Nervustrella is the one that loves Minivip in spite of himself ; conversely , Happy Betty's minions include a strongman dubbed " The Colonel " and the pint-sized , monocle-sporting Schultz . The film is driven by a superb song score courtesy of Franco Godi that includes a mournful lament by Happy Betty's imprisoned , unsuccessful experiment subjects and a climactic production number performed by the villains themselves when hoist in their own petards . Comic highlight : the " day in the life " demonstration of Happy Betty's assembly-line workers .
463644	2467618	35356	4.0	I love Gable ' s films but this script stinks	While I always enjoy Clark Gable films ( heck , I even enjoyed PARNELL ! ) , this one only got worse the second time I watched it . I know this may sound misogynistic , but Clark acted as if he was experiencing a world-class case of PMS throughout most of the film and Lana Turner just seemed pretty stupid due to the poor writing of this script . Clark , inexplicably , plays not just his usual rogue , but a genuinely confusing and back-biting brother - - and this , along with his odd behaviors , make him pretty unlikable . That's really bad , as he is supposed to be likable down deep , not a sexist back-stabber whose behaviors seem almost bipolar ! And , despite the fact that deep down Clark is a jerk , Lana STILL insists on following him to the ends of the Earth ! This woman really needed to be less of a codependent , plus it made absolutely no sense WHY she picked Clark over his handsome and decent brother played by Robert Sterling . Now if you can ignore the basic stupidity of Clark and Lana in this film , what's left is very good . The character of Clark's brother is both well-acted and written . The integration of pre-war and wartime attitudes of Clark's newspaper is also very interesting and I loved the sparring he did with the editor early in the film - - particularly when he stole the old appeasers clothes - - that was " pure Gable " all the way . Plus , the entry into the war and the final portion of the film was exceptional and exciting as well - - the film REALLY could have used a lot more of this type inspiring action and a lot less than the totally uninspired romance between Gable and Turner . The only odd thing about this , by the way , was Gable and his brother sneaking into China through the swamps wearing suits and ties ! That was just dopey . All in all , a very mixed bag of a film . Worth seeing to Gable fans , but it is far from one of his better films .
552505	989035	61418	6.0	Bloodshed in the American Dustbowl . . .	Although numerous chapters in cinema manuals have been dedicated to Arthur Penn's violent , jagged , cynical " Bonnie and Clyde " - - and , indeed , it kick-started a new permissiveness in America movies which then generated many imitations - - the first twenty or so minutes of the picture are really awful . Depression-era waitress , bored and thrill seeking , finds herself drawn to a smooth-talking , reckless hood , an ex-con who , when playfully dared to , robs a general store right in front of her . He's sexually impotent but does have a sympathetic heart for the unfortunates and the working class ; she's a high-wire act , strictly amoral and greedy . Their initial meeting outside her house has all the conventions of a standard 1930s drama - - and just because the movie's look is generally correct doesn't mean what's happening on the screen is original . Producer Warren Beatty and screenwriters Robert Benton and David Newman envisioned the French New Wave in regards to the film's approach and style , and their efforts paid off in this respect ( it's a very good-looking picture , shot by Burnett Guffey , who won an Oscar ) . However , Arthur Penn's direction isn't visionary , and the multiple car-riding shots with back projection don't seem to break new ground . The film's greatest achievement aside from its textured look and feel is the casting : Beatty and Faye Dunaway do pretty marvelous work in the leads ; Gene Hackman and Estelle Parsons also fine as Clyde's brother and sister-in-law ( Parsons won the film's second of two Oscars as Best Supporting Actress ) . The violence grows increasingly , steadily , as the film inches toward its queasy conclusion , while Penn juggles ( successfully at times ) ribald character moments with deadly serious - - and bloody - - scenes ( which also became fashionable ) . The sweat and the flies , the downtrodden and the righteous , they all get a work-out in this scenario , which , in its best moments , has a prickly-comic and dangerous edge . from
438342	306861	30447	10.0	A Mouse Tale For The Birds	A Walt Disney MICKEY MOUSE Cartoon . Bumped out of a moving van , a hot-tempered parrot takes refuge in Mickey's home . MICKEY'S PARROT is an excellent little film , with very fine animation and some good gags . The plot follows Pluto more closely than Mickey , but that is not unusual . Despite a strong debut , the Parrot would make no further appearances in any Disney animated films . Mickey's voice is supplied by Walt Disney . Walt Disney ( 1901-1966 ) was always intrigued by drawings . As a lad in Marceline , Missouri , he sketched farm animals on scraps of paper ; later , as an ambulance driver in France during the First World War , he drew figures on the sides of his vehicle . Back in Kansas City , along with artist Ub Iwerks , Walt developed a primitive animation studio that provided animated commercials and tiny cartoons for the local movie theaters . Always the innovator , his ALICE IN CARTOONLAND series broke ground in placing a live figure in a cartoon universe . Business reversals sent Disney & Iwerks to Hollywood in 1923 , where Walt's older brother Roy became his lifelong business manager & counselor . When a mildly successful series with Oswald The Lucky Rabbit was snatched away by the distributor , the character of Mickey Mouse sprung into Walt's imagination , ensuring Disney's immortality . The happy arrival of sound technology made Mickey's screen debut , STEAMBOAT WILLIE ( 1928 ) , a tremendous audience success with its use of synchronized music . The SILLY SYMPHONIES soon appeared , and Walt's growing crew of marvelously talented animators were quickly conquering new territory with full color , illusions of depth and radical advancements in personality development , an arena in which Walt's genius was unbeatable . Mickey's feisty , naughty behavior had captured millions of fans , but he was soon to be joined by other animated companions : temperamental Donald Duck , intellectually-challenged Goofy and energetic Pluto . All this was in preparation for Walt's grandest dream - feature length animated films . Against a blizzard of doomsayers , Walt persevered and over the next decades delighted children of all ages with the adventures of Snow White , Pinocchio , Bambi , Peter Pan and Mr . Toad . Walt never forgot that his fortunes were all started by a mouse , or that simplicity of message and lots of hard work always pay off .

But I'm getting ahead of myself , you see Lilith was the first woman made by god as a companion to Adam . But she got all uppity evil feminist so god banished her from Eden . A clandestine order known as The Fath captures her but doesn't kill her , so now with amnesia ( which is not really explained that well ) Lilith ( now Elle ) is free to become the aforementioned Buffy-clone who has to battle with a mad scientist who got an injection of Lilith's blood . If the previous paragraph sounded hideously convoluted , that's because it is . The movie is also dull , generic , and for a film with a plot steeped in theology it doesn't seem to know a lick about it .

574124	4532636	482571	6.0	Fine Looking Production Wasted on an Incoherent Script	Christopher Nolan's latest puzzle movie is like a big heaping plate of spaghetti : when taken together , it looks like a complete and satisfying meal , but if you pick up any one noodle individually , you find that it's not connected to any of the others and just trails into nothing . I felt like a complete moron walking out of this movie , because I completely missed the big surprise twist at the end . My wife had to explain it to me on the way home . But in thinking back on the movie , I decided that the fault did not lie with me ( or so I'd like to believe ) . Christopher and Jonathan Nolan have written a muddled and confusing screenplay , in which every single plot detail ( and there are many ) gets equal weight and nothing takes central focus . The ending doesn't feel so much like a creative twist as it does a cheap trick . The performances are fine , though none of the characters ever comes alive . There's so much intricate plot to race through that no one has time to develop any nuance into their roles , and all of the characters serve as ciphers for the plot rather than as psychologically believable and consistent individuals . Christian Bale comes off best ; Hugh Jackman is as bland as ever ; Michael Caine is just kind of there ; and Scarlett Johannsen may as well not even be in the movie for the importance placed upon her . Movies like " The Prestige " bug me . They spend all of their time trying so hard to trick and mislead that they never get around to telling a compelling story that I care anything about . Five minutes after you walk out of the theatre , the plot starts unraveling like wet Kleenex , because the film doesn't build its plot from the character level up ( which the other magician film from this year , " The Illusionist , " did and which is why that's a better movie ) . " The Prestige " is a magic trick that leaves you wanting your money back .
429886	1173088	364725	6.0	A good silly movie that is everything " Anchorman " should have been .	When I heard of " Anchorman , " I thought the premise was inspired , and with its cast I was sure it would be a great stupid , silly comedy . Unfortunately it turned out to be a major disappointment and the companion piece of the year - - " Dodgeball " ( another hopelessly silly comedy ) - - turned out to be the better of the two and brought in some $30 million on opening weekend ; quite a feat for a film featuring an actor accused of starring in too many films ( Ben Stiller ) and an actor whose career has been reduced to shambles recently ( Vince Vaughn ) . " Dodgeball " is by no means a great comedy or an important piece of work but it doesn't have any pretensions to be . It follows in the path of slacker underdog movies like " Animal House " and just about any sports movie you can think of but it doesn't try to be anything more than what it is : an entertaining piece of trash . This is not out to win an Oscar , its purpose is to make us laugh and I did so quite a bit . Vaughn is perfectly cast as an average Joe who owns a gym called Average Joes ( ah , irony ) . Stiller is the owner of the competing " Globo-Gym , " a super-slick company with a $4 million price tag and an interesting company slogan : " We're better than you , and we know it ! " When Peter ( Vaughn ) fails to pay off debts his gym faces foreclosure and he must raise fifty thousand dollars or else Stiller will buy his land and turn it into a huge parking lot for Globo-Gym . So in order to raise the cash Peter and his die-hard gym members ( a pack of idiots , losers and a wannabe-pirate [ ? ] ) compete in the American Dodgeball Association of America ( I didn't get the joke the first time I heard it ! ) against Globo-Gym's Purple Cobras team . Ben Stiller's been getting on my nerves a bit lately , wearing his put-upon-nice-guy shtick into the ground . He's reached a point - - along with Vince Vaughn , Owen Wilson , Will Ferrell and Luke Wilson - - where they all just goof off in their movies , performing cameos or appearing in starring roles , and at first it's pretty amusing but after a while the whole Troup Stiller / Wilson routine gets old . . . " Anchorman " had Ferrell , Wilson , Stiller and Vaughn , and " Starsky and Hutch " had the other Wilson , Stiller , Vaughn , Ferrell etc . . . not to mention the fact that Duplex , Meet the Fockers and Along Came Polly all featured performances by Stiller that were eerily similar . Anyway suffice to say Stiller gives his best 2004 performance in " Dodgeball , " creating an over-the-top character who's very similar to the obsessive weight loss instructor in one of his earliest comedies , " Heavy Weights , " which might be a sequel of sorts to this since " Dodgeball " supposedly takes place in 1993 and that movie took place in 1994 . . . Overall " Dodgeball " is just good silly fun . Stiller is doing another one of his usual routines but he's a great deal funnier than he has been in many other films last year , and I like him better as the angry freak rather than the put-upon shmuck , which he's simply done way too much lately . The movie delivers laughs and doesn't attempt to do anything else . . . I'm not making this out to be a great movie because it's not . It's the sort of popcorn flick I'd watch if it came on TV in the future - - worth a rental at least .
469430	1532177	66958	3.0	Don't Know About Terror But It Is Terrible	A cheaply made British film from the early 1970s is what CRUCIBLE OF TERROR is , but you'll never believe how bad it is untill you actually watch it . The plot is just basically a whodunnit where it's so obvious that you know straight from the first murder who's behind the killings , except at the very end there's a plot twist that will have you reeling and not in a good way either . It's as though the producer realised how obvious the killer was that he instructed the screenwriter to forgo any credibility to make ( You'll never guess who ) the murderer at the very last minute . The other thing that had me reeling was the performance of Mike Raven who struck me as a cross between Roger Delgado ( The original master from Doctor Who ) and Christopher Lee . It's not too difficult to believe that Mr Raven disappeared from the acting world after making this crazy movie
452708	15896852	58105	4.0	Luke's Lagoon	Luke Halpin ( as Sandy Ricks ) is home alone when he's informed said home is going to be taken away by the state of Florida ; apparently , the state has let the land to the Ricks family , and they need it back . Mr . Halpin's father Brian Kelly ( as Porter Ricks ) is away , and mother Martha has passed away since the original " Flipper " ( 1963 ) . Halpin is majorly concerned , because losing the home means losing the shore where he lives with pet dolphin Flipper . Halpin and Flipper run away from home ; incredibly , they find an isolated island nearby , and take up residence . AND , wouldn't you know it ? - kidnappers are also nearby ; they snag a British father , and let his wife Helen Perry ( as Julia ) and daughters Pamela Franklin ( as Penny ) & Francesca Annis ( as Gwen ) drift to Halpin's island paradise . Ms . Franklin performs well as Halpin's emerging co-star . Halpin's performance is touching ; he and Flipper carry the film . With all of the newness and nuances gone , this sequel is certainly not up to the original . The story is so wildly implausible , Flipper should have shouted , " RE-WRITE ! " Just for starters , Ms . Perry and " Gwen " must have very poor vision , hearing , and critical thinking skills not to figure out about Halpin . And , the songs are awfully lush . The ending holds some excitement , if you last . Halpin is still cute - older by a few years , due to the first " Flipper " being on the shelf for a few years . Flipper is still cute , too ; and , TV father Brian Kelly is on board , replacing Chuck Connors as father Ricks .

364552	4888011	59319	7.0	How to describe it ?	I should identify that " The Ipcress File " is not the easiest movie to describe ; the truth is , it's a little hard to follow . In the role that turned him into a star , Michael Caine plays cockney agent Harry Palmer , hired to investigate the brainwashing of some scientists . I think that's what happened , but the movie confused me a little . I would say that this movie functions best if you look at it in a historical context . Aside from dealing with the Cold War , we get to see mid-'60s London . Specifically , Palmer lives in a dreary flat but is called to investigate things involving geopolitics . Some people note that this was around the same time as the James Bond movies but " The Ipcress File " was more intellectual . I guess that in a way it was ; James Bond mostly bedded hot babes . But overall , I would recommend watching this movie as a historical reference more than anything .
518173	8239592	62946	2.0	An extremely dreary and forgettable clunker	Veteran character actor Marc Lawrence stars as your basic evil scientist who creates a dangerous , murderous , not-to-be-trifled race of robotic killer gorilla slaves . Lawrence's plans to overthrow the world are thwarted by a musclebound lunk ( stolidly played by former Hercules Brad Harris , who shows off his brawny chest as often as possible ) who's ventured into the doc's remote corner of the jungle in order to rescue some beautiful gal Lawrence has abducted . Seedy , grim , slow and humorless , with only the lovely presence of bodacious jungle babe Esmeralda Barros walking around mostly nude and the sporadic cheeseball gorilla gore effects offering any slight relief from Roger Morris ' static direction , a drab , talk-heavy script , uniformly stiff acting from an understandably uninspired cast , tatty production values , inert pacing , pathetically crummy and unconvincing ape suits , and a general air of ponderous , unrelenting tedium , this flick overall sizes up as a sleep-inducing dead slug of a stinker .
405374	2020269	265105	1.0	It's okay to be gay . It's not okay to make crap movies	Wow , this movie is even gayer than " HellBent " ! What are the odds of that ever happening ? I don't think David DeCoteau ever had the intention of making a horror movie ? He clearly just wanted to surround himself with athletic & handsome twenty-something boys , so he quickly thought up a scenario about a college fraternity of vampires . Instead of action & suspense , we get an whole army of male students parading in their matching tight white boxer shorts and instead of gory massacres we get insecure boys openly talking about their feelings and emotions ? for hours ! Two young losers meet each other on the first day of college . Chris has the body of a regular jock , but he's the sensitive type , so he doesn't want people to judge him based on his appearance . The other one , Dan , never stops nagging about how unpopular he was in his previous school . They befriend a girl with an incredibly beautiful rack ; still all they ever talk about is their mutual friendship . In come the boys of the Domo Tau Omega fraternity ; pretentious little pricks with sunglasses that rule over the university . Their leader ? super gay dude Devon ? wants Chris to join his elite group because he fancies him . Poor Chris doesn't know , however , that they form the gayest coven of vampires horror cinema has ever brought forward . " The Brotherhood " is a terrible film . There's not even an attempt to build up tension or atmosphere and DeCoteau didn't even bother to insert some cheesy horror effects . The vampires suck , all right . But not blood ? They suck at making themselves appear menacing and evil . The dialogs are abysmal and the production values are overall poor , barely disguising the fact that our director is more interested in shooting porn movies . Or maybe put together catalogs for men's underwear . He should do so , and quit misleading fans of horror films . The cast members may be yummy eye-candy ( at least , for certain target groups ) , but none of them has the slightest bit of acting talent . One to avoid at all costs .
385625	391152	372784	5.0	Mediocrity	A nice effort , I suppose , but a failure nonetheless . I actually prefer the first three installments of the 1980s & 1990s Batman franchise , though none of them are great movies , either . Tim Burton ? and even Joel Schumacher ? brought at least some vision into their Batman worlds . Nolan attempts to do this realistically ? that was the original idea , anyway ? but he is bogged down by screen writing and action movie clichés . There weren't half as many explosions in all four of the 90s Batman films combined . Batman Begins does little to deepen the story , as some critics have claimed . The backstory was told perfectly , and with great economy , in 1989's Batman . There was no emotion lost . Nolan takes nearly an hour to tell it , and he doesn't make it any more interesting . They didn't find a better actor to play Batman . Christian Bale is as dull as Keaton , Kilmer , and Clooney . The villains are uninteresting . Ra's Al Ghul ( which is mispronounced throughout the film ) has always been my least favorite of the Batman villains . Dr . Jonathan Crane , aka " the Scarecrow " is wonderfully played by Cillian Murphy when he's out of his mask , but he is supremely uninteresting when he's in it ( doesn't help that Nolan resorts to stupid distorted images and noise pollution whenever he puts the mask on ) . Katie Holmes is a wonderful actress in small projects , but , like Natalie Portman , she doesn't translate well to blockbusters . Plus , Tom Cruise just ruined her for me . Gary Oldman and Tom Wilkinson are horribly miscast ( Wilkinson as a mob boss ? ) . They actually might have just switched roles and it would have been better . The only things the film gets excessively right are Alfred and Lucius Fox , played by Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman . But , really , while these two consummate actors bring an air of class to this kiddy pool , they out-act both the hero and the villains to such an extent that it warps the movie . I really should not desire more scenes with the butler . I should add Liam Neeson to that , as well . He's very good , and perfectly cast . Batman Begins is often a good actioner , but it should have been much better .
437656	306861	21549	10.0	Square One For Screen Legends	An eccentric hypochondriac staying at an Arizona dude ranch finds the time - when not popping pills - to make a little WHOOPEE ! The emergence of two diverse talents make watching this film special . Banjo-eyed Eddie Cantor , already the darling of the Ziegfeld Follies , became a fully fledged movie star in this tale of utter lunacy , his own special brand of innocent insanity completely at home in these surroundings . Never still for long , legs & hands constantly flittering about , he punctuates every double entendre with eyes rolled up as if in mild shock at his own dialogue . His handful of songs , including his signature tune ? Making Whoopee , ' only further showcase his abundant talent . This was also the first significant assignment for choreographer Busby Berkeley . He displays his genius in embryo with his precision movements ( greatly influenced by his exposure to military drills ) and initial examples of his trademark overhead shots . The film's production entirely in early Technicolor gave Berkeley a rich palette with which to work and he acquits himself well , even if his Indian maiden costumes near the end of the picture exhibit rather dubious taste . Cantor dominates the cast , but Ethel Shutta has a few good moments as Eddie's stern nurse and elderly Spencer Charters , playing the ranch's owner , has a hilariously bizarre sequence in which he & Cantor examine each other's surgical scars . Movie mavens will recognize a young , uncredited Betty Grable as the chorus girl with the lasso in the first song . A glance down the credits shows a couple of names of note : Nacio Herb Brown was among the foremost movie songwriters of the era ; Greg Toland would later be hailed as one of Hollywood's finest cinematographers . The film makes a point of dealing with bias against Native Americans . Cantor's blackface comedy sequence will then perhaps be a bit of a surprise to some , but it should be remembered that this sort of racial insensitivity was not unusual in the movie industry of 1930 .

That's what I got it for - the music . The advertisement said , " jubilant , revitalizing musical . " Well , there are songs in here but they don't last long . Mostly , this is a documentary on Willie Mae Ford Smith and Tomas A . Dorsey , pioneers in black gospel music . They are wonderful people - solid Christians - but the documentary , quite frankly , is boring . If one is a big fan of these two , it might be a jewel , but to fans who simply want a concert of gospel music , this isn't it .
558703	2626332	408236	10.0	Tragically Beautiful . . . Visceral .	Tim Burton's " Sweeney Todd The Demon Barber of Fleet Street " encourages its viewers to lick their lips at the prospect of this work as the ideal treat , and perhaps we should . In the remaking of this story , going half way will bring nothing to the work ; nothing to the world , and Burton seems to realize this , as he goes nowhere if not all the way . He not only walks up to the theoretical bell , but he rings it , unabashedly . Hailed as the bloodiest musical in the history of the stage , it now becomes the bloodiest adaptation of a musical to film in history , and it isn't a joyful gambol . This is a dark telling of deeds driven by heartbreak , filled with a desperate chaos and ( pardon the awful and probably often-used pun ) bloody good meat pies . But fans of the work know all this from the start , and we feel endeared that Burton keeps the story close to the source ; a fact which , for those hapless members of the viewing audience who have no prior exposure to this twisted historical story , promises no happy ending for our characters . In all actuality , the audience receives a much better ending than a mere banal happiness could convey ; no cavorting romps through fields of wildflowers for them ! It receives the only ending possible because Burton does not attempt to rewrite history in his telling . Contributing along this twisted Memory Lane are beautiful darkling performances by Johnny Depp , Helena Bonham Carter , Ed Sanders , and Alan Rickman , with the demented silhouettes of Dariusz Wolski's cinematography , and a diabolical ( and slick ) production style by Dante Ferretti . Each of these lovely elements comes together to allow Burton to conjure the visceral essence of a 19th century London reflected so aptly by Henry Mayhew's " Labour and the London Poor , " a serious influence over famous Dickensian works , which assumed the sad and often disgusting job of reporting on London's more seedy " Cheep Side . " The heart-beat of the story itself is so strong as to lend a palpable pulse to this work . The ( anti - ) heroes are forged of the heartbreak of life itself ; its villains are made villainous by life itself , and they all waltz to the Death March played wistfully on the flute of that same life , which has forged their very beings . The acting is so poignant that it enrolls us as subscribers to this diabolical tale . And even as we gasp and cover our mouths in shock , there is the hint of a sardonic smile at the corner of our mouths , as the dark humor does not escape its target . Burton lovingly creates this musical with a near lover's touch , with vocal performances which are intimately offered , softly whispered , lovingly delivered . These darkly delicious Sondheims are filled with despair paired with a desperate longing for a world untouched by the evils of man . They are plot-driven and carry the story , rather than interrupting it . In reality , this film works as pseudo-history . It is not meant that we should take it as fact , but that it delivers the story without resorting to tongue-in-cheek camp . This is a completely beautiful balance ; delicate and even fragrant , and Burton never fails to stop to point out its beauty in an incongruous way . This is a tragedy , in which Johnny Depp delivers a near-Biblical performance . The surprise is that instead of taking Helena Bonham Carter with him , she walks along beside him on her own tragic , but capable path . All in all ? I loved this work . It is darkly wonderful , and our two stars never missed a mark . This is suitable for watching on Friday / Saturday nights , but NOT by an audience any younger than 18 without fear of mandatory life-long therapy . But I love it . It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .
462805	2467618	19901	9.0	Absolutely amazing that this film is practically unknown today	It's funny that until recently I hadn't heard of this film even though I am a huge fan of silent films and talkies . This is even more surprising because the film was so good - - being one of the very best early sci-fi films . In fact , aside from director Lang's more famous METROPOLIS , it is probably the best full-length silent sci-fi film you can find . And in so many ways it is very unlike METROPOLIS because the film seems rather plausible ! It seemed that those who made WOMAN IN THE MOON really wanted to make a film that looked like a realistic film about the first moon landing . Considering that the film came out in 1929 , I think it did a really good job of trying to get it right . Of course , the details weren't exactly right , but you could sure tell that Lang consulted with astrophysicists and other scientists to get it as close as they could to reality . The actual take-off , for example , was simply breath-taking - - looking pretty realistic and using models that looked amazingly real even today ! ! Seeing the enormous-looking rocket being ferried to the launchpad was spectacular and just plain cool . While this attention to details COULD have made the film very dull and documentary-like , the addition of the subplots really lifted it in mood and made it very engaging . The hero of the story and his mentor are actually threatened by a cartel of five evil robber barons who want to take over this private space program ! So , out of a desire not to be killed , they are forced to take along an agent of this cartel - - who turns out to be destined to wipe out all those on the ship and take back gobs of gold to his evil masters ! As a result , the film was infused with some excellent action and suspense . So my final verdict is that this silent film is simply amazing and worth seeing by anyone who is patient enough to watch a silent film without whining . Plus , historically speaking , this film is a true treasure - - see it an be amazed .
564445	102816	437330	7.0	Treading water .	Metal Slug 4 is certainly the weakest of the series so far with rehashed levels and same-old baddies . You get the option of a new playable character ( or at least it looks like someone new ) but what is the point of having four separate , playable characters when they all have the same ability ? It's not even like they come with different guns . And why do you get a life bar when only one bullet kills you ? This game does give you the bonus of ONE new weapon-the double machine gun . But every time you pick it up someone will come along and kill you . Honestly , these games are so damn hard . It's fine if you have infinite continues or an infinite supply of quarters but how on earth they expect you to survive to the end of the level with all your stats intact is beyond me . They should remain until your next continue instead of vanishing with every life lost . Yes , the level design is brilliantly detailed and the humor is still there but it's too hard and it's getting mighty damn repetitive . Give us something new for Metal Slug 5 please .
427502	3079504	949880	9.0	Scary documentary about what the Soviets were really doing in the US during the cold war	Under the radar documentary about KGB operations in the US pre-1982 is a scary little film even in retrospect , since it would seem what the Soviets were doing at the end of the 70's and start of the 80's are now being done by terrorists . Have we learned anything ? Clearly not . This is a great dense little film about what the Soviets were doing here . Its picture of spies running loose and unchecked in America is a frightening one and seems to be the reason that this film has been largely unseen for the better part of the last two decades ( why advertise your mistakes ? ) . How infiltrated were we ? They talk about the Russian embassy by my house on Long Island and how it existed basically as a means of listening in on phone calls from a major aircraft manufacturing plant and New York City . Not really shocking since everyone in the area suspected it but here's the proof front and center . You don't want to be proved right about somethings . Also front and center are the stories of the soviets flooding the US with spies and attachés ( we see pictures and learn their names ) , as well as their techniques for infiltration . The cold war maybe over but this little baby is very unsettling .
582371	1219578	69439	4.0	An ersatz Chabrol movie .	The turn of the decade ( sixties / seventies ) was Chabrol ' s heyday . To reproduce his ( commercial and critical ) success , the same ingredients were chosen ( a murder mystery , a bourgeois house , Stephane Audran , Chabrol's then wife playing parts of twin sisters - after Olivia de Havilland , why not her ? - , Chabrol in the flesh in a cameo - he's the Pullman's inspector - ) to give the flick the aura of . . . . an ersatz Chabrol movie . There are , at a pinch , two good suspenseful scenes ; the wheelchair on the road , pursued by a car , and the hanged man in the graveyard which pack a real wallop . Etienne Périer was to continue in the ersatz Chabrol vein with " la main à couper " , but he was luckier with his " un si joli village " ( 1978 ) which was closer to Cayatte / Boisset social criticism .
576756	1399158	34902	6.0	Invisible Agent ( 1942 )	Of the " Invisible Man " series made by Universal , I was only familiar with the first two ( both of which I'll rewatch again presently ) - the James Whale original being one of my all-time favorites . Ever since it was released as part of the " Legacy " set , I had mostly read negative opinions about this film - and even Leonard Maltin gives it a pretty low rating . However , I was very surprised by how much I enjoyed it ! True , the leads are rather bland ( why on earth is Ilona Massey credited before Jon Hall ? ! ) but , then , INVISIBLE AGENT has a formidable trio of villains - Peter Lorre , Sir Cedric Hardwicke and J . Edward Bromberg - going for it ( who even make Curt Siodmak's script sound better than it is ) . Besides , I must say that I'm a sucker for both WWII and espionage movies , so that's a big plus as well . . . which , I guess , means that it isn't really a horror film and that The Invisible Man is the hero ! Oh well , you can't have everything ! John P . Fulton's still-impressive special effects ( exposed a bit here by the extra clarity of the DVD transfer ) deliver the goods and , all in all , the film made me keen to get to the remaining titles in the series .
436215	9938570	119784	7.0	The Night Flier	I have to say one of my choices as a horror sleeper from the 90's is this little creepy grisly effort from director Mark Pavia , based on a Stephen King story , regarding a narcissistic , manipulative , and ultimately vicious tabloid reporter who'll stoop to the lowest level to keep his story on the front page , meeting his match when he begins tailing a vampire killer flying a black Cessna plane who hypnotizes victims around plane air strips throughout Northeastern United States , the rural routes of small town America . At the bottom of his plane is maggot-filled earth , and inside , smeared throughout the controls is dried blood , collected over the his time of mutilation and death . Julie Entwisle , just a bubbly , high-spirited cutie presented as the perfect little fish to be devoured by Miguel Ferrer's cunning shark , tries to forge her way into the tabloid's upper tier , starting from the bottom with a key ability to get forms of information difficult to reach for the paper's top piranha . Anyway , we see as he flies in his own plane from destination to destination , Ferrer's Richard Dees working through the first murder sites , gathering bits and pieces from whatever he can find , through testimony and bribing coroners for photos of mutilated victims . We also get a chance to see his ways of flamboyant journalism by disturbing a victim's grave , adding ugly dead flowers and his own blood ( . . while even stooping so low as to move the gravestone ) . . everything is for getting the top story printed with extra spice . I think the idea of the main character being a real slimeball could hurt the film for many because it's much easier to cast a likable hero who we feel sympathy for as he / she pursues the killer leaving a graphic trail of gruesome murders , with throats ripped open so badly that the head is pulled apart from the neck displaying bloody flesh . There's even one scene where the head is ripped completely from the body , placed in an appropriate area as to show those who investigate that the vampire can operate without restraint almost teasing the authorities to catch him . The opening kill shows long gashes down a male victim's face . . good , gory carnage is left in this vampire's wake . The closing sequence is one that receives mixed reaction . I've read from some who love it , believing it's the most effective portion of the movie , while others believe it's the most harmful . I particularly love the scene where we have Dees , after finally becoming sickened by the airport lobby slaughter by the vampire , watching from the mirror as the invisible count takes a leak , with the urine being blood red . . haha , nice touch . The B & W portion where Dees confronts victims , dressed as vampires , as the count allows him to see what it's like from the other side , I thought was a nifty little moment of nightmarish power . I think we have been spoiled rotten by DVD special features , given access into the movie-making behind-the-scenes effects process . For some , the practical effects of gore , displaying the killer's grisly methods , will receive less of an impact , but I enjoyed them even though I know how they are brought to life ( . . I think for some , the nasty open wounds from the vampire's finger nails look less effective , and we can understand how they were created ) . I think the casting of Ferrer is ideal just because of the type of character he portrays . He indeed has a taste for bloody carnage and the vampire , through the final climactic sequence , first seeing the wake of violence of an entire group of people awaiting a trip to some unknown destination , and the B @ W vision through a taste of the killer's blood , gives him an opportunity to experience just that . The audience does get what they crave , this bastard's comeuppance . He wanted that front page and gets it , but this time , Entwisle's young reporter ( . . who gets shafted by Dees ) benefits . It's a fitting conclusion , I think , which speaks volumes for why this film must have an anti-hero as the main protagonist . I like how the film presents Dees , the backstories of those with stories to tell of past victims to him , the sleazy process of how he operates , and the way Dees falls to the one warning him to stay away . I loved the ending with how Dees , who basks in exploiting whatever works to bring him success , becomes the victim .
420615	2542703	35211	10.0	" Pride of the Yankees " Hits Memorable Home Run	Superior biography of Lou Gehrig who had everything before ALS paid him a visit . Gary Cooper is terrific as Gehrig . He was the embodiment of a plain , aw shucks guy who made it big in baseball . Teresa Wright had the right flavor as Eleanor , his loving wife . There are fine supporting performances by Elsa Janssen and Ludwig Stossel as his parents . The film is great because it shows a warm , loving family , poor financially but rich in spirit . Rather than concentrate on all his baseball achievements , the film deals with Gehrig , the man and what a great , kindly gentleman that he was . Walter Brennan , who made so many films with Cooper , appears again this time as a sports writer . He befriends him and becomes a close family friend . Dan Duryea , as a cynical reporter , is quite effective in a small role . He seems to have it in for Lou but succumbs like everyone else during that famous farewell speech . What also made this film a classic was the use of Babe Ruth and other Yankees play themselves . Had the Babe lived , he could have been in films . A definite film detailing the human spirit . When Gehrig meets the boy that he had " hit 2 home runs " for years later , your heart will go out . That scene , along with the farewell speech , was poignant .
514664	317399	490086	6.0	A Nutshell Review : Big Stan	The only other movie I remember vividly with the protagonist fearing his upcoming time spent in jail , was in Spike Lee's powerful drama 25th Hour , where we follow Edward Norton's character in his final day of freedom before being sent to the slammer . In Big Stan , Rob Schneider's crooked time-share conman Stan got arrested in the opening minutes for fraud ( and you might think it's for racism ) , and spends much of the first act mulling over the fear of getting raped in jail , for not being part of any gang , and a first timer wussy who's easy target for the lonely tough guys behind bars . Thanks to his crooked lawyer Lew Popper ( M . Emmet Walsh ) and the crooked system ( from the judiciary right down to the prison warden , who as the movie states , are always made to look like dicks anyway ) , he gets six months off before he has to present himself to the courts to begin his sentence , in in this period of time , tries his best to look " undesirable " . Help comes in the form of The Master , played to good campy effect by David Carradine , star of the 70s Kung Fu series , whom I last saw in Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill movies playing well , yet another stereotyped kung fu master . Thus begins the tried and very tired formula of the kooky training regime with strange food and diet , coupled with near impossible feats like titty-weight training . Granted there were some genuine sight gags , but sad to say they all get confined to this particular sequence . The trailer would have already spelt it all out for you , and suffice to say that the best bits were already inside . The story by Josh Lieb seemed to have run out of steam even before the mid-way mark , where Stan had already entered the jailhouse , and asserted his tougher than tough , no nonsense , keep away demeanour by punching the lights out of the meanest rapist in jail , and a few others . If you're looking for end to end laughter , then you're likely to be bored once Stan becomes head honcho in getting some respect in jail . With that out of the way , the movie degenerated into series of clichés , and the usual nasty warden with nasty plan routines . It didn't help that supporting characters here were stereotyped into playing stereotypes , conveniently split into the different cliques and clans . Directed by Rob Schneider himself , his films to date has somewhat been of a hit and miss for me . Lending his prowess to supporting roles like in You Don't Mess With The Zohan and Click , I thought he usually fared better in those , unlike having to carry the movie solely on his own , ala Deuce Bigelow and The Benchwarmers . What I found out unfortunately is that they usually start off strongly with quite a unique premise ripe for the cracking of some insane jokes , before fizzling out halfway and coasts through some predictable drama to the finale . Still , some laughs are better than none at all , so if you really feel that you need some light hearted medicine , then you'll find some joy in the beginning , but that's all .
450390	2093818	111003	6.0	Not what it could have been , but worth a viewing	Not having read any of the highly acclaimed writer Robert A . Heinlein's work , including the original novel " Puppet Masters " , I can't really comment on whether or not this piece does him or his work any justice , but from a point of view that hasn't in any way been influenced by his work or others ' opinions ( . . . maybe scratch that last one ) , I must admit that it's not half bad . The plot is pretty good , and it keeps developing at an adequate rate , while keeping a fair pace , but it seems to drop a tad once this entered its last half or so . The acting is decent enough , with Donald Sutherland being the one to stand out and deliver a marvelous performance . The characters are well-written , well-casted , credible and believable . This is strangely similar to TV features , in the way it's shot and edited . The special effects are great , but short of spectacular . The creature design was reasonably interesting , and well thought out , and the related effects are actually relatively nicely done . The science fiction aspects of this , with the aliens and their actions are well-done . I liked the way the film utilizes mood and atmosphere rather than excessive gore to scare and thrill the audience . The atmosphere and mood are decent enough , just not as well-done as they could have been . The movie also fails to inspire the same paranoia and fear that , for example , John Carpenter's The Thing does . Finally , the climax was a bit overly Hollywood-like , but hey , this does provide about 110 minutes worth of sufficiently entertaining science fiction-horror about the always dreaded extra-terrestrial invasion . I recommend it to fans of the genre and / or Donald Sutherland ( it should also be noted that Keith David rocks , as he has something of a tendency to do ) .
482906	1293485	110657	7.0	Are you kidding ? ! I loved this Karate Kid !	After a very disappointing Part 3 , I kinda wondered if I should even bother with The Next Karate Kid , while I could see why this saga wouldn't continue , I still enjoyed The Next Karate Kid most out of the second and the third Karate Kid movies . While there are some very unrealistic moments and situations , it was very enjoyable and the story is a catchy and warm one . Hilary Swank , has this girl come far or what ? She plays a rebel girl who has lost her parents to a car accident and when Miaugi sort of " babysits " her per say , he notices that she has karate skills . He offers her more lessons if she becomes more serious in life . Now of course there is the boy that likes her and the mean bullies that are pretty similar to the first Karate Kid , but I would recommend this one . I think you'll be pleasantly surprised .

364852	4888011	120716	5.0	no comparisons with " Life is Beautiful " , please	First , I want to say that Robin Williams is one of my favorite actors , and one of the funniest people alive today . Which makes it all the more disappointing that he doesn't get to do anything in " Jakob the Liar " . A lot of people compared this movie to " Life is Beautiful " ; if anything , it just ripped that one off . This story of a Jewish man in Nazi-occupied Poland trying to give everyone hope just can't create a believable presence . It's not terrible , just nothing creative . And I'm probably not the only person who thinks that Williams's career hit an all time low in 1999 , as he starred in this and the apparently dreadful " Bicentennial Man " . Fortunately , he's made a comeback since then ( I expect a cool performance from him in " Night at the Museum " ) . Also starring Alan Arkin , Bob Balaban , Michael Jeter , Armin Mueller-Stahl and Liev Schreiber ; they probably and Williams want to downplay this movie when describing their careers .
544320	562732	139462	9.0	Despite obvious and almost crippling weaknesses , Message In A Bottle comes out on top .	Message In A Bottle is the interesting but extremely unlikely story of a woman who tries to find the author of a romantic message she found in a bottle that had washed up on a beach . Robin Wright plays the part of Theresa Osborne , who works for the Chicago Tribune . She is touched by the beautifully written note , and upon her return to Chicago , she manages to get it printed in the newspaper . Needless to say , the paper is flooded with responses , someone reports having found a similar note , and the search begins . This is where the real problems come along , because some of the clues that come along and the way that they are followed are just too unlikely , and this is made even worse by the quickness with which Theresa finds Garrett ( Costner ) . Think about the possibilities of finding a note in a bottle on a beach somewhere that been floating for who knows how long , conducting some kind of search ( however thorough ) , and then finding the person who wrote it . ( spoilers ) On the other hand , this is a romance , and the premise is nothing if it's not romantic . Because of that , Message In A Bottle makes a great date movie , but in that case , the ending was probably too much . It's cool to go out and watch a tear jerker every once in a while , but you don't want your date to be crying her eyes out all night . That's not cool . It's actually kind of hard to form a quick opinion of Message In A Bottle , because the way that Garrett was searched for and eventually found , although it was probably the most efficient method , was extremely unlikely . But on the other hand , it makes for some quality romance . Then you find that the ending was almost too painful for it to be effective as a romance film , but on the other hand , at least they didn't slap on a cutesy happy Hollywood ending to make all the saps happy . I have to admit that that impressed me , because it makes this a unique film . While I was actually watching the movie , I noticed a lot of things that really bothered me , but when I looked back after it was over , I could see that it was really a good film . The ending doesn't satisfy as a romance , but it's good to see something different once in a while .
432786	2171244	82776	8.0	Rape and revenge	Looking like a schoolgirl ( probably intentional ) as she was reportedly only 17 when they made this film , and mute , Thana ( Zoë Lund ) is the perfect victim . After two rapes , she manages to find the strength to kill her second rapist and proceeds to dispose of him . She disposes of the body parts from her rapist in some very innovative ways . It gets funny . There is not the rage of Death Wish , but terrifying flashbacks and slow transformation into a killing machine . She starts to really get into her role . We get a bit of nunsploitation when she goes to a party as Sister Thana . I never had any nuns in school that dressed like her ! Things really got fired up at the party . One can argue that a man got her in the end . Look for the symbolism . A great revenge movie .
584548	1219578	180607	1.0	sheer rubbish	Thomas ( Elie Semoun ) is a shy computer scientist who created a virtual person called Leo from a software program . But the latter is sick of his life and years for getting out of it to explore the exterior world . One evening he manages to do so by taking the appearance of a cleaning operative ( Dieudonné ) and it's a chain of problems that awaits for Thomas . The starting point and the direction this two-bit comedy followed weren't that much fresh but at least a minimum of rigor and attention was required from the crew to make this menu watchable . But the dearth of pristine ideas touched the scenarists and the efforts deployed by the crew are hardly discernible . In short , there is strictly nothing to save from this flavorless product which lazily follows a constricting , ultra-mapped scheme . The whole affair also plumbs because of a heap of commonplaces used as bridges for a skimpy story . As if it wasn't enough , a flabby directing makes all the comical effects fall flat . Anyway , many of them are so corny and well-worn that the audience remains impassive . Elie Semoun and Dieudonné are as expressive as zombies and one can regret their one man shows . Ditto for the humorists Jean-Marie Bigard and Franck Dobosc who hold here wasted minor roles . The glaring shoddiness that wraps this film from the first minutes plunges the audience in a crushing torpor . And however , the thrust was interesting . Had it been given a better treatment . . .
419210	1609079	20670	1.0	Fanny batters the big screen	Fanny Brice is one of those old-time performers who remains well-known only indirectly , through an impersonator : nowadays , most people who think they're familiar with Fanny Brice's style as a performer are actually recalling Barbra Streisand in ' Funny Girl ' and ' Funny Lady ' . ( A similar problem exists with George M . Cohan , whom most people know only through James Cagney . ) Personally , I've never understood the appeal of Fanny Brice , and I suspect that most of the people who claim to be Brice fans are really thinking of Streisand's two movies , which do NOT depict Brice's life or her personality with any accuracy . If you want to see a movie which tells the true story of Fanny Brice's life , watch Alice Faye in ' Rose of Washington Square ' . . . a movie which is so accurate in its depiction of Brice's romance with Nick Arnstein , the characters ' names had to be changed to prevent Brice from suing . Fanny Brice made very few films ; late in her career , she starred in a popular radio sitcom as Baby Snooks , a bratty little girl . When performing this role , Brice would actually dress up in costume as a small girl , thus creating the misperception ( which I still encounter ) that radio actors often dressed up as the characters they played , for the benefit of the studio audiences . Brice was the only radio actor who did this . ( Although a few other radio actors occasionally wore costumes for publicity photos . ) ' Be Yourself ! ' is a poor film , although the underrated director Thornton Freeland does his job well with weak material . Part of the problem is that this movie is almost but not quite a musical : Fanny sings a couple of numbers , but they're spaced very thinly through the movie , so the transitions are jarring . And the movie isn't really a comedy either ; Fanny makes a few wisecracks , but this film is basically a character study ( of the male lead , not Fanny Brice's role ) . Although Brice gets top billing , the plot of the movie is really about the washed-up boxer played by Robert Armstrong . The make-up man has equipped Armstrong with a severely flattened nose , which looks quite realistic and is appropriate for his character . . . but it also looks very distressing . Every time Fanny Brice looked at Armstrong , I expected her to sing " Second-Hand Nose " . This movie suffers from the presence of Harry Green , an actor who portrayed Jewish stereotypes in much the same way that Stepin Fetchit played Negro stereotypes . Harry Green's " Yiddisher " schtick grew so annoying that he eventually became unemployable in Hollywood , and he landed up in England . . . giving exaggerated portrayals of pushy American Jews for British audiences who had no frame of reference for these characterisations . Some parts of ' Be Yourself ! ' are so weird , I can't even guess if they're intentionally strange or merely inept . When Robert Armstrong's Irish-American boxer first becomes attracted to Fanny Brice's character ( named Fanny Field , but clearly meant to be Jewish ) , he moves in with her . A few minutes later , Fanny Brice is screeching her way through a ditty : " My baby wants bacon , so that's what I'm makin ' , and I'm cookin ' breakfast for the one I love . " Nobody connected with this movie , including Brice herself , seems to find any irony whatever in the idea of a Jewish woman cooking bacon ( which she just happens to have handy ) . I can't even tell if the irony is intentional : maybe the lyricist just needed a rhyme for " makin ' " . At one point in this movie , Armstrong calls Fanny Brice ' a funny girl ' , which in post-Streisand hindsight looks like a deeply significant line , but wasn't meant to be . I'll rate " Be Yourself ! " precisely . Fanny Brice really didn't have the right sort of talent for movies .
454833	11228318	235193	9.0	Ask Grandma is a sweet and hilarious " Our Gang " short	This Hal Roach comedy short , Ask Grandma , is the thirty-eighth entry in the " Our Gang / Little Rascals " series . Mickey is depressed because his mom wants him to be a " hothouse flower " when he'd prefer to be a weed . In other words , he'd rather be with the other boys and ride the two-plane merry-go-round outside instead of going out for ballet lessons . The only family member he can confide in is Grandma as she loves to do backflips and they play catch and spar together . When he sees bully Johnny pick on little chubby Joe , he confronts him . Then he sees the note his mom gave him with " No Fighting " listed and backs off with Johnny teasing him . There's also a girl , Mary , that both Mickey and Johnny are smitten with and as his rival manages to get her to ride the two-plane ride , Mickey gets jealous and tells his grandma of his feelings for Mary . Grandma encourages those feelings and after Johnny once again teases Mickey , tells him to " keep on slammin ' " . He does just that and is encouraged by nearly everyone , even Mary who's seen Johnny's brutal side and happens to think Mickey's " cute between the freckles " , except at first by his mother . Then she is reminded by Grandma of her tomboyish ways ( provided in flashback with Mickey playing her as a child ) and eventually promises to let her son be a " regular boy " from now on . . . This was one of the sweetest and hilarious " Our Gang " episodes ever with Grandma coming off best in terms of excitement and personality . It's too bad that neither IMDb nor the definitive book on " Our Gang " , " The Little Rsacals : The Life and Times of Our Gang " by Leonard Maltin and Richard W . Bann , has the actress that played her in the cast list . Her scenes with Mickey are so full of joy that you wish you knew someone like her in your life . Mary is at her most alluring here and the way she kisses Mickey and his reaction is one of the most priceless I'm seen of their shorts so far . The fight at the end with Mickey almost defeated by Johnny and his father before Grandma socks the father was the short's highlight and reminded me of a similar ending for the later " Little Rascals " talkie , The First Seven Years with Jackie Cooper that I was charmed by as a child . So as with many of these other silent " Our Gang " shorts I've discovered on YouTube , I highly recommend Ask Grandma . P . S . Once again , I've got to give props to the poster who added the LeRoy Shield music from the " Little Rascals " shorts as performed by the Beau Hunks Band .
452583	15896852	305357	4.0	Angels with Dirty Faces	The script seems more coherent , compared to the last one . . . It's comic book live action storytelling . . . The production is very much like a string of music videos . . . The worst musical interlude is something involving angels Drew Barrymore ( Dylan ) , Cameron Diaz ( Natalie ) , and Lucy Liu ( Alex ) as " Sound of Music " nuns cruising a cute priest , then playing with bird poop . . . " Bosley " becomes a noun instead of a character , with Bernie Mac taking over the role - upping the level of " broad comedy " . The original series had a more subtle wit . The Angels don't show any more than they showed in the sexier " Charlie's Angels " ( 2000 ) . But , you do have a tighter story , and some much appreciated continuity . Original angel Jaclyn Smith ( Kelly ) makes a heavenly cameo appearance , and Demi Moore ( Madison ) " returns " from an untold intervening era . She seems a little like Kate Jackson , but takes a " wrong turn " . There is quite a long span before Moore emerges as a main character - after Barrymore's villainous former boyfriend takes center stage .

482980	1293485	90583	6.0	21 years later and this story remains true as ever	I just bought a DVD with About Last Night and St . Elmo's Fire , I figured since it was 5 dollars to give it a look . I watched About Last Night first , I have to say that this movie despite it's dated look and music , is still vital to today's world of love and sex . It's amazing how we still haven't changed that much , huh ? But anyways , onto the movie , over all acting and the way that About Last Night was shot , I'd say this was a decent movie . It's still somewhat of a classic to this day , it starred a couple of the famous members of the brat pack , Demi Moore and Rob Lowe who had absolutely amazing chemistry on screen and really brought the relationship to life . While I admit , that this is very dated , it's all good , most of our movies will one day be dated , it's kinda fun to see what life was like then . I was only 1 years old when this movie came out , so those shoulder pads would've weighed me down , lol . Despite the dated look , the story is as true as it ever was today . Debbie and Danny , first off , how corny are these names put together ? OK , back onto the story , they meet at their favorite bar and hook up , it seems like the most common one night stand . But they can't help but think of each other , so they continue on with their sexual relationship . But they are getting more and more serious with seeing each other , so they move in together , as just room mates as first . But eventually they decide to try a relationship as boyfriend and girlfriend . But things get very difficult with their two best friends who are just rooting for their relationship to crumble to pieces . Then they must confront the difficult part , is there anything they have past than just the physical attraction ? You'll have to see for yourself . About Last Night is a good movie , the acting and over all film is average , it's watchable . It has a little comedy to it as well , so it's not all drama . It's got some steamy moments between Demi and Rob , I have to say that it was beautifully shot in the scene where they first say I love you to each other . But this movie really did get to me because I could totally relate to Demi's character on every level , I think that's another plus is that it is written very realistically and doesn't just have them be all happy again after all their problems , it's very realistic to what trials a relationship goes through . I would recommend About Last Night , it's a good film and a fun time capsule .
418540	1609079	123380	2.0	Incest and Eskimos	The most impressive thing about ' Anemic Cinema ' is its title : an anagram which is very nearly also a palindrome . Unfortunately , it only works in American English , since in Britain ' anaemic ' is spelt differently . I've always found the dilettante Man Ray and his artistic efforts to be deeply pretentious , and I've never understood why his work attracts so much attention . Apart from his Rayographs ( which he invented by accident , and which are merely direct-contact photo prints ) , his one real contribution to culture seems to be that he was the first photographer to depict female nudity in a manner that was accepted as art rather than as porn . But surely this had to happen eventually , and there's no real reason why Ray deserves the credit . The critical reaction to Man Ray reminds me of the story about the Emperor's New Clothes . Back in the early 1960s , the second season of ' The Twilight Zone ' opened each episode with a shot of revolving concentric circles in black and white . There's an image in ' Anemic Cinema ' which is so similar , I wonder if ' Twilight Zone ' borrowed it from this film . The main difference is that the revolving image here is a black and white spiral . Indeed , if ever there was any movie that deserves to be described as a spiral , this one is it . Throughout ' Anemic Cinema ' , we're treated ( ? ) to shots of a revolving disc containing words ( in French ) moving in a spiral . The effect is vertiginous , and the texts - - about incest and Eskimos - - are nearly Dada in their meaninglessness . I did laugh at one clever sexual pun . The emperor is naked , folks , and this movie just barely rates . Au suivant !
384782	391152	848557	7.0	Not Romero's best by a long shot , but not nearly the failure that I had heard it was	Romero returns to the zombie well for the fifth time . And , yes , it's gotten old now . These stumbling monsters have shown surprising resilience in the past 60 years ! Romero goes big theme hunting here , exploring the current video - and internet-obsessed youth culture , dusting off that old film-making-is-voyeurism chestnut ( with dozens of shots of characters staring daggers at whoever's operating the camera at the moment ) , but I think he fails to say anything especially interesting . Truth be told , I don't think he was particularly insightful in any of the Dead movies , save maybe the class-consciousness of the undervalued Land of the Dead . But , come on , if you really think the whole " people be acting all like zombies at the mall " thing counts as deep social commentary , you're overselling it more than just a little . But wait ! I didn't say I disliked the film . In fact , quite the opposite ! It's not Romero's best by a long shot , but the guy is a consummate filmmaker , there's no doubt . I went into this with low expectations , given the reviews , but I was entertained by it . Romero delivers on stuff like gore . You'd think he'd have imagined every possible zombie situation , but then you get stuff like a scythe through the head or hydrochloric acid eating away at a brain . The film comes off much like Blair Witch meets Night of the Living Dead , and it's about as successful as the other Blair Witch rip-off of this year , Cloverfield . It isn't as frightening as Cloverfield , but I'd say , with its more interesting characters , it's about equal .
479440	463200	91671	1.0	Pathetic	Librarian Vincent Price tells 4 horror stories of the town he lives in . Unfortunately , the audience has to see them . The stories aren't scary at all , are sick ( necrophilia ; a nude middle-aged woman being drowned ; knives in a man's groin ) , boring and stupid . It has a good cast ( I'm assuming they were all desperate for work ) and they do what little they can with the lousy script , but it's no go . Of interest only as one of Price's final films .
402877	453228	49366	7.0	The Oldest film I reviewed	We saw this film after seeing the two remakes . It was in the cult section of our video store . It is the first B & W movie I reviewed . The story holds up well ; much better than some of today's horror / suspense films . It would be disturbing to be in a society that has no emotions . No one would believe you if this actually happened .
452840	15896852	289992	9.0	DeathWatch ( ? or Sex , Lies , and Videotape )	University of Austin philosophy professor Kevin Spacey ( as David Gale ) is a well-known death penalty opponent ; ironically , he is about to be executed for the rape / murder of co-protester Laura Linney ( as Constance Harraway ) . With four days to live , Mr . Spacey tells beautiful reporter Kate Winslet ( as Elizabeth " Bitsey " Bloom ) his story - vehemently asserting he did NOT kill Ms . Linney . Ms . Winslet listens to Spacey explain the events leading up to the crime , which we see in " flashbacks " . As she hears Spacey's testimonial , Winslet begins to investigate the unfolding mystery , with smoking intern Gabriel Mann ( as Zack Stemmons ) assisting . The final , final twist wasn't a complete shock ; but , there is a great deal of welcome uncertainty throughout most of the film . Alan Parker's " The Life of David Gale " is a roller-coaster - managing to be suspenseful , unpredictable , and thought-provoking . The part that comes closest to misfiring is Spacey's drunken rant about Plato , Socrates , and Aristotle . But , the character was , at the time , a philosophy teacher battling alcoholism . In fact , Charles Randolph's story is very tightly written ; with wall posters , stuffed animals , and car trouble all making complete sense . Winsome Winslet and Mr . Mann are the " present " story co-stars , with " flaming liberal " Spacey and Linney leading the " flashback " cast . The two different story lines are crosscut beautifully . The acting is exceptional , with Linney probably outdistancing the others - she certainly has the most demanding role , which she performs courageously , and without a double . How does an A-list actress , like Linney , receive no " Best Supporting Actress " consideration for her work in this film ? As a movie pair , Winslet and Mann are quite impressive . Mr . Randolph , director Parker , and the cast make both the major and minor characters memorable . The film could have been given a more interesting title than " The Life of David Gale " ; too bad " sex , lies , and videotape " and " DeathWatch " were unavailable . In the past , this basic story appeared under titles like " Capitol Punishment " , " Circumstantial Evidence " , and " " Beyond a Reasonable Doubt " . However labeled , this is one of the more engaging takes on the ancient law . The Life of David Gale ( 2003 ) Alan Parker - Kate Winslet , Kevin Spacey , Laura Linney , Gabriel Mann
515337	317399	1032755	7.0	A Nutshell Review : RocknRolla	Guy Ritchie is probably right at home with his own brand of English crime capers , which is full of machismo over the top action sequences , tough talking , black comedy , and an all round edgy feel to it , not to mention the frequent casting of Jason Statham , who has since moved on from the Smoking Barrels , Snatch and Revolver days . In fact , it's been a good 8 years since we last saw Ritchie's feature films on screen , since Revolver had a straight to DVD release here , and Ritchie's widely panned effort with Swept Away starring his wife Madonna being avoided with a ten foot pole . So with RocknRolla , Guy Ritchie can announce and signal his comeback to the much loved genre where he's probably a master of , except that this film still had much to be desired , albeit containing elements of his signature style . We go back to the usual crooked czar where Tom Wilkinson's Lenny Cole heads a small team of gangsters who fleece unsuspecting land / home buyers in real estate , until such time where he thought he had a big fish for the kill in the coming of a wealthy Russian mobster . But after the same pot of gold , knowingly or unwittingly getting themselves embroiled in the big scheme of things , include Thandie Newton's accountant Stella , Gerard Butler's small time hoodlum One-Two , and a rock star Jonny Quid ( Toby Kebbell ) , a druggie who fakes his own superstardom death . While you can't fault the good ol ' almost watertight linking of everyone to everyone else , the narrative did feel that it needed some nip and tuck as it does tend to indulge in itself a little by getting too meandering in its presentation , throwing up a chock full of supporting roles by Ludicrous or Jimi Mistry the corrupt Councillor . One example of such an indulgence happened to be one of the more entertaining action sequences involving some hard to put down Russian gangsters , who were much like robotic Terminators with Energizer fuel cells that keep going on and on , though it did serve its purpose with self-deprecating humour for a character to trumpet his own horn . And the characters here are a mixed bunch , most of whom were the stars in a relatively simple black versus black plot . The lead narrator Archie ( Mark Strong ) tends to stay out of the picture most of the time , seemingly comfortable to passing the baton to Butler who relatively has more star power , but Wilkinson single handedly steals the show with his gangster who made it big through the misfortune of others who fall for his cunningness . Thandie Newton as the seductress never really get much to do here except to pout and roll her eyes , despite touting to be the best in the business in creative accounting . You can count on Ritchie to conjure some really visually attractive scenes and sequences , coupled with some memorable dialogue . Though I must admit that RocknRolla here did seem a little bit homophobic , especially when there's a running joke that runs throughout the film involving One-Two and fellow peer Handsome Bob ( Tom Hardy ) that went on for a tad too long , although I must admit some of it were genuinely hilarious in its own right , especially when left to your own devices to imagine what transpired given the deliberate omission of crucial details stemming from character embarrassment . And running along the same idea of a gag in letting your imagination run wild , is the make up of a valuable lucky painting that you just don't get to see . All in all , RocknRolla still proved itself to be quite an entertaining feature , and for fans of Ritchie , the wait is finally over . Not his greatest work to date , but nothing too shabby either .
408793	2567136	45591	7.0	Past The Dead Wood Stage	This must have been like a breath of fresh air in 1953 . There hadn't been an ' Original ' screen musical for several years , instead there had been several ' bio-pics ' of composers / performers and Day had even featured in one ( I'll See You In My Dreams , the biopic of lyricist Gus Kahn ) herself . So this Annie Get Your Gun-lite ( a love-hate relationship between two sharp-shooters , ' challenge ' duet ( Anything You Can Do , I Can Do Without You ) pushed all the right buttons . If you're prepared to suspend disbelief and respond to a fine score then you'll enjoy this one . Allyn McLerie shows what she might have been had things turned out differently and her Broadway background showed - she was , for a time , married to Adolph Green , and appeared in several shows including Where's Charley - and makes a fine second lead . Howard Keel points up the links to Annie Get Your Gun and apart from bursting into Higher Than A Hawk for no discernible reason , proves a decent enough foil for Day . Sammy Fain was an excellent composer though the Oscar-winning Secret Love is much inferior to his earlier I'll Be Seeing You , from a Revue , Right This Way , in 1938 . Overall all this is a pleasant romp .
422464	2248099	65073	7.0	Camp Dracula returns !	Hammer studio's Dracula series comes second to it's far better Frankenstein series - that's obvious - and the reason for that is that the films tend to be very similar to one another . Of course , the same thing could be said about the Frankenstein series ; but at least the latter obviously tries to make each instalment a unique entry in the series . Dracula tends to take the easy route and go for the simple ; Dracula gets resurrected and kills some people shortly before getting defeated again , only to reappear in the next Dracula film . It has to be said that this entry in the series suffers from that affliction , but in fairness to it ; Taste the Blood of Dracula definitely sports one of the better plots in the series , and is probably the second best film - after the original of course . The story this time round follows a circle of three bored gentlemen who get duped into resurrecting the count by a young upstart ( Ralph Bates , in fine form ) who offers them an experience beyond belief . Havoc ensues . One of the principle reasons why this film works is that the campy Hammer style features in droves . You know you're watching a Hammer film when you see three straight-faced ( even slightly worried ! ) men in an antiques shop negotiating the price of a vile of Count Dracula's blood ! The campness continues throughout the movie , and it's always good to see . As usual , Christopher Lee appears for all of about five minutes and the acting is mostly left to a cast of unknowns , but they carry it well and every moment that Lee is on screen is delightful . The script is rather corny , naturally , with several unintentional comic delights that are sure to delight Hammer fans . Most of the Dracula clichés are present , and since we live in a world now where it's become a cliché to step away from clichés , it's nice to see a movie that has a lot of clichés in it . On the whole , this is a decent waste of time and I very much doubt that fans of Hammer horror , Christopher Lee , Dracula , Playboy magazine or even ham and pineapple pizza will be disappointed with it .
422638	2248099	87884	8.0	Excellent and potent tale of loss	Paris , Texas is my first ever taste of acclaimed director Wim Wenders , and while the film isn't exactly sweet ; it's certainly not bitter enough to steer itself away from the realms of the masterpiece . Paris , Texas is very much a character driven story and it follows the account of a man that wanders out of the hot desert sun with an acute case of amnesia . When his brother , Walt , finds him , he helps him to remember his life , and we then watch as our protagonist rekindles his former relationships first with son , and then with the mother of his child . Wim Wenders handles this story with the utmost skill , and it works thanks to the tentative way that he portrays the characters to the audience . Just like the town of it's title ; Paris , Texas is basically a film about being lost . I ( and I'm sure many other people ) didn't even realise that there was a place called Paris in the middle of Texas , and this little place is symbolic of the substance that is at the core of this movie . The film doesn't benefit from any big name actors , but the actors in the movie do give it their all and ensure that it doesn't fall down on the acting side . Harry Dean Stanton takes the lead role , and does a good job in , at first , portraying a man consumed with amnesia ; and then consumed with the time he has lost . Nastassja Kinski is the only member of the cast that has a really notable list of film credits other than this movie , but ironically she has the least screen time of the five leads . Every minute she is on screen is a delight , however , and she lights up the screen with both of her talents ; looks and acting ability . The young Hunter Carson gives a rare child performance ; i . e . one that isn't incredibly annoying , but strangely he didn't appear in very many movies after this one . The climax to the tale is more than satisfying , and is easily one of the most haunting and potent I've ever seen in a film . Wenders shows his talent with both the execution and the implications of it , and it's a satisfying end to a very satisfying movie . Recommended .
556572	1406078	285531	6.0	Big Chill in Maine	Watching this film convinced me we should leave dealing with aliens to people that might be able to present them in a better ' light ' . Hello , calling Mr . Spielberg . . . . . . If we consider the talent involved in this film and what comes out on screen , supposedly adapted from the Stephen King novel , it is a big disappointment . Mr . Kasdan , the director , and Mr . Goldman , the screen writer , have given us better things , so this venture will not harm their achievements . Some parts of the film are quite enjoyable . It is entertaining , if we forget the silliness of Morgan Freeman's bushy eyebrows , ( I wonder whose idea that was ? ) and Jonesy affecting the English accent of his alter ego . The trouble I had with this film is that it doesn't want to make up its mind whether to play it straight , or go for laughs , since nothing is made clear throughout the length of it .
368893	2488512	264692	6.0	A Reasonable Mystery Tale of Revenge	Mário Velasquez ( Gracindo Júnior ) is a powerful , successful and wealthy businessman , having a ruined marriage with Gabi ( Estér Goes ) . In a fancy party , he meets a mysterious woman , who advises him that his is precisely going to die in seven years from that day . In the scheduled date , he is kidnapped by a gang leaded by his former employer Peçanha ( Osmar Prado ) , who had defalcated his company and was sent to the prison in the past . While arrested , Mário tries to negotiate his own life , when the mysterious woman comes again to discuss with him . Although having a great performance of Gracindo Júnior and Osmar Prado , and a reasonable direction of Marcelo Taranto , the screenplay of ' A Hora Marcada ' is full of flaws . Firstly , there are many characters that are not well developed , and the first line happens only after 5 : 32 min running time . The character of the mysterious woman is not well explained : if she is Ms . Death herself , she is physical , since she drinks champagne with him in the bar , being served by the bartender . Why did she predict and advised Mário about the day of his death ? However , the personality of Mário Velasquez and the motives of Osmar Peçanha are very clear and make this movie a reasonable mystery tale of revenge . Title ( Brazil ) : ' A Hora Marcada ' ( ' The Scheduled Hour ' )
492478	3280905	36135	10.0	He Whips To Glory !	James Mason ( like Richard Burton , Edward Arnold , and many other splendid actors - and actresses ) never received the Oscar for any of his performances . This is one of the unfair side issues regarding the Academy Awards , as a measuring stick to film stardom . Everyone who has seen Mason's performances ( and the others I mentioned ) may know they are appearing in a " turkey " , but they are serving their sections of the " turkey " with deluxe dressing . When they are appearing in " filet mignon " or the like , they really reach the heights . So , despite his lack of Academy recognition , Mason is remembered with great fondness by everyone who enjoys movies . To this day his voice is imitated in cartoons if you want to see a snooty , aristocratic villain . Yet I said " villain " . How can I call the wounded , deserted IRA gunman Johnny ( ODD MAN OUT ) or Norman Main ( A STAR IS BORN ) or Humbert Humbert ( LOLITA ) a " villain " . Yes , he did play Mr . Van Dam in NORTH BY NORTHWEST , but even that fellow had his less villainous moments ( too few perhaps ) . The fact is , when Mason came to the U . S . to appear in Hollywood films in the late 1940s , it was as one of Britain's best villains . This was odd . He had been in films since the late 1930s , and had played a shell shock victim in THE HILL HAVE EYES as well as other parts . In FIRE OVER ENGLAND ( an early role ) he was an English Catholic nobleman who is planning to aid King Philip of Spain ( for reasons of politics and religious freedom ) but who is drowned fleeing the police of Elizabeth I . None of these performances had gained him his fame , deserved as it was . It was THE MAN IN GRAY that gained him fame . Set in Regency England ( c . 1790 - 1837 ) , Mason was what was termed " a Regency Buck " . This was a fashionable , upper crust Regency aristocrat or wealthy man who enjoyed his privileges - frequently at the expense of everyone else around them . When Leslie Howard played Sir Percy Blakeney in THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL , his character is a foppish version of " the Regency Buck " , acting the buffoon at the expense of Col Higgensbottom and even the Prince of Wales - regarding cravats - to hide his serious mission ) . Mason's character is actually a more openly forceful version of this character . The Marquis of Rohan is a great grandee of England ( despite having the last name of a noted French Aristocratic house - connected to the " Affair of the Diamond Necklace " ) . He is fully aware of his position , and the subservient position of everyone else involved with it . Phyllis Calvert is Clarissa , the daughter of a local good family , who was a close friend of Margaret Lockwood ( Hester ) . Their relations is similar to that of Amelia Sedley and Becky Sharp in VANITY FAIR , as good girl and bad girl . Rohan chooses to marry Clarissa because she is a proper ( and subservient ) wife to breed an heir . Clarissa tries to help Hester by getting her a good position in the household ( bad mistake ) . Rohan is soon bored by marriage , and Clarissa mistakes this as a signal that she is on her own . She meets a traveling actor named Rokeby ( Stewart Granger ) and starts a relationship with him - egged on by Hester . Hester intention is to reveal it at the right time to Rohan , and replace the disgraced Clarissa . And she does . But it actually does two things . He does go after Rokeby to kill him . But after taking care of that problem , Rohan finds Clarissa going into physical decline . And his better character comes out . He tries to help his wife , but nothing he does helps . . . and she finally dies . The Marquis is heartbroken . SPOILER COMING UP : Hester still blind to the reality of the situation , confronts Rohan , and reveals her own passions . But now Rohan is fully aware of why Hester made her revelations , and what it has led to . Furious at being used , and at his own cost and of the woman he got to love , Rohan grabs a horse whip and whips Hester to death ! It is an orchestrated , violent conclusion ( and it's violence may be why the film is rarely shown on television ) . Despite making Rohan a killer at the end , because he is killing the real villain in the plot Rohan gets the audience to cheer him on ! He becomes the " anti-hero " of the story . It gained Mason his international standing as " a man you love to hate " . And it opened the doors to future Hollywood stardom .
441659	819382	45546	7.0	Emblematic of its type .	Nicely done genre movie , filled with familiar roles and the expectable sequence of events . An atomic blast near the North Pole melts the ice surrounding a Rhedosaurus . ( Ie . , a big lizard . Very big . ) The beast is spotted through a blizzard by one of the scientists monitoring the explosion ( Paul Hubschmid ) . He's hurt in a cave in and taken to a New York hospital . When he tells his tale , guess what ? Nobody believes him . The psychiatrist says that in his condition , what he saw could have been an hallucination . And the monster's roar ? The wind plays tricks on the ear in those latitudes . Even his friend , Kenneth Toby as an Army colonel , thinks he's joking . But Hubschmid persists and contacts a paleontologist ( Cecil Kellaway ) and his requisite pretty assistant ( Paula Raymond ) . Kellaway dismisses his claims too , at first , but Raymond sticks up for Hubschmid . And why not ? Hubschmid is a tall actor with an alluring foreign accent . As an actor , he brings two qualities to the role : he's tall and has a foreign accent . Tall men with foreign accents are always attractive to women , while we normal guys , with faces no more imposing than they should be , and good old red-white-and-blue American speech get shoved off to the side . Of course I knew Hubschmid would not only survive the encounter with the monster but would emerge as the hero , but I must say I was a little disappointed . Why couldn't the Rhedosaurus have torn him limb from limb ? Oh , yes - - the plot . Hubschmid identifies the Rhedosaurus from a drawing but Kellaway still doesn't believe him until the witness of another catastrophic meeting with the dinosaur is brought in and IDs the same drawing . Then everybody gets down to work . Kellaway , with his glasses and his pipe , is the prototypical professor in these 1950s SF films . He's short and cherubic . He goes down in a diving bell to the bottom of the Hudson River trench at 20 , 000 fathoms . ( The Challenger Deep , the deepest part of any earthly ocean , is 6 , 000 fathoms , but let it go . Let go , too , that Kellaway claims the Rhedosaurus lived in the Paleolithic , about 20 , 000 years ago , when the dinosaurs were pretty much wiped out about 60 million years ago . The play's the thing . ) It was surprising to find that Kellaway's diving bell is destroyed by the Rhedosaurus and Kellaway and his Coast Guard companion presumably eaten . Usually , the innocent old gentleman survives . The beast is working his way south from the North Pole , striking more or less at random , a fishing vessel and the lighthouse that provided the basis for Ray Bradbury's original short story . Finally , the feckless beast surfaces in a population center , New York City in this case , as many such monsters do . Small arms don't seem to do much more than irritate him , and there's another problem . Wounded in the neck , Ray Harryhausen's dinosaur drips lethal radioactive blood . The only solution : Fire a radioactive isotope into his neck wound so he can die without bleeding all over the place . This is accomplished with the help of an Army sharpshooter - - Lee Van Cleef in , I think , his film debut . And the Rhedosaurus thrashes around in his death throes , destroying half of Coney Island in the process . As is often the case , one can't help feeling a little sorry for the Rhedosaurus . After all , he only came to New York , presumably , looking for conspecifics and , with any luck , a suitable mate . His intentions aren't dishonorable . He's not a man eater like the shark in " Jaws . " Oh , he gobbles up a cop in New York , but the cop is only an amuse-bouche , not part of his staple diet . The beast is an underwater creature and would probably be perfectly happy to be left alone , with only occasional passengers on the Staten Island ferry as prey . Anyway , except for Kellaway , everyone of consequence survives and Paul and Paula probably are married and live happily ever after .
455254	11228318	22219	7.0	Ol ' King Cotton was my first look at singer George Dewey Washington	Having just discovered this obscure singer named George Dewey Washington on Ol ' King Cotton from a series of shorts compiled for the DVD " Hollywood Rhythm , Vol . 1 : The Best of Jazz & Blues " , I must say he's a fine singer ! The first part takes place in his yard near a shack in the South as he sings a song that seems inspired by Kern & Hammerstein's " Ol ' Man River " which I think is the title song . After his wife sends him away to a delivery job on a train , we see him there talking with his co-workers about the South and how much he misses it . He then sings about levees breaking and the sun shining afterwards that made me think he could've been referring to Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans but was possibly actually singing about the Louisiana flood in 1927 . The short ends back where we started before the fade out . Largely because of the singing , I found this pretty entertaining .
368301	2707735	37638	7.0	" That's life , whichever way you turn , fate sticks out a foot and trips you . "	Ann Savage gets my vote for the person I would least like to meet under any circumstances , much less as a hitchhiker at a desert gas station . Her character Vera in Edgar Ulmer's noir mind bender " Detour " sets a new standard for women of her disposition , those with a capital ' B ' . The film builds intensity as it's protagonist Al Roberts ( Tom Neal ) finds himself in a nightmare world , if not of his own creation , then at least one in which he shares major complicity . His character's voice over narration reveals a tortured mind , feverishly painting himself into a corner from which there is no escape , until events spiral out of control and strand him in an emotional twilight zone . It would have been interesting to see how any number of scenarios might have played out given some of the film's set-ups , such as the dying millionaire or the mysterious coughing fits suffered by Vera . Instead , her manic manipulation of the spineless Roberts suggests only one sure outcome , that at some point this powder keg must detonate . One might have expected a more direct confrontation , though Vera's demise is ultimately suited to her own unique propensity for evil . Sorry , wrong number . " Detour " is a strangely disorienting movie , with a reputation that transcends it's modest origins . Even it's ending , which seems like the end of the road for Roberts , leaves enough left open to the imagination to suggest that perhaps he can work things out with just the right roll of the dice . But what about Haskell , what about his dying father , what about Vera's corpse at the rooming house , what about Sue ? The movie leaves more loose ends than any other I've ever seen , and doesn't even seem to care . In that respect , it's a lot like Al Roberts at the end of his rope , with the viewer left to decide whether or not to kick out the chair .
497884	1355507	183649	7.0	Really smart & enjoyable thriller .	Phone Booth is set in New York where Stu Shepard ( Colin Farell ) lives & works as a celebrity publicist , Stu calls a girl named Pamela ( Katie Holmes ) who he is stringing along from the last public phone booth in New York on the north side of West 53rd Street between Broadway & 8th Avenue . When done he puts the phone down but it starts to ring as he is about to leave the booth , curious Stu picks it up only to discover some real psycho on the other end ( Kiefer Sutherland ) who has a high powered sniper rifle aimed right at him & will kill him or an innocent bystander unless he does exactly what he wants . . . Directed by Joel Schumacher I have to admit that against all expectations I thought Phone Booth was a great thriller . It's Larry Cohen's smart fast moving & original feeling script which is the films main strength , set almost entirely in one location the premise which revolves around a guy stuck in a phone booth doesn't initially sound that promising but the script is really absorbing & pulls you into the intense situation Farell's character finds himself in which plays out during the film in real time like the TV series 24 ( 2001 ) . It manages to have a swipe at the media & the police while it makes you question just who is the bad guy , I mean Sutherland's character is obviously doing wrong but he's doing it with good intentions . At less than 80 minutes in length the time flies by , it never lets up for a second & once it has you hooked on the interesting premise it doesn't let you go right until the very end & even then you'll still be thinking about the ending as the end credits roll . The character's are very well written , the situation is maybe a little silly & one could debate that it would be virtually impossible to emulate in reality . A much better film than I had expected & a really smart little thriller that'll pass 80 odd minutes like they were 80 odd seconds . Director Schumacher goes for sped up scenes , split screen techniques so more than one person can be seen on screen at once & goes for a bleached look as the film has a blue washed out tint throughout . There's also a really cool opening & closing sequence which show's what you can do with CGI computer effects if they are done properly . Apparently the film was shot pretty much in sequence & took a meagre 12 days to shoot overall . According the IMDb's ' Trivia Section ' the sniper was originally played by Ron Eldrad but was replaced by Sutherland in re-shoots . With a modest sounding $10 , 000 , 000 budget ( it made something like 15 million on it's opening weekend ) this is well made essentially in the same location , shot on location in New York & in Los Angeles . The likes of Will Smith , Mel Gibson & Jim Carrey were all attached to Phone Booth at one point or another but I think it works well with a relatively low key unknown cast . Phone Booth is a really cool fast paced thriller that I enjoyed immensely , it's short , smart , gripping & original . I was impressed , very impressed .
364414	4888011	69704	10.0	The Wolfman is everywhere , and so will this movie be forever . It really twists the night away !	In the movie that made him famous , George Lucas portrays several teenagers in Modesto , California , in 1962 . Various things happen to them , and they see all sorts of things . Of course , the movie's other stars are the songs that make up the ultra-cool soundtrack . With a total of 45 classic tunes , this movie is a great time from beginning to end . You'll never forget the prank that Curt Henderson ( Richard Dreyfuss ) has to pull with the police car . Maybe some people might complain that the movie didn't really have much purpose , but that's too harsh ; the point was for everyone to have a good time . And boy do we ! With the soundtrack , plus great performances by Dreyfuss , Ron Howard ( billed as " Ronny " for the last time ) , Charles Martin Smith , Paul LeMat , Cindy Williams , Candy Clark , Harrison Ford and Wolfman Jack , " American Graffiti " is a wonderful romp even today !
438509	1617546	32916	7.0	Play or Pay	Warner Brothers continued its campaign to get Kay Francis to break her contract not just by lowering the quality of her vehicles , not just by loading her dialogue with ' r's or putting her in horse operas , but now by lending her out to other studios . She was the highest-priced actress on the Warner's lot and they didn't want her any more . But she was not going to give up that contract . In this lend-out to RKO , Miss Francis , as usual , gives a wonderful performance . In fact , given the cast of minor players - - including a few long-time favorites of mine like Nigel Bruce and Kane Richmond - - and they give fine performances too , even if we are expected to believe Mr . Bruce hails from Chicago , in this minor comedy . It's about a professional adventuress who is getting a lot too old to play wealthy men for suckers . It's a little slow-starting , but by the half-way mark , it is moving along at a good clip . Definitely worth your while .
370074	2488512	139822	4.0	Boring and Confused	In 1937 , the German family Kranz immigrates to the South of Brazil , settling in a hotel in the country . The members of the family are sympathizers of the Nazis and worship Adolf Hitler . One of the young woman of the Kranz was seduced and abused by a SS officer , arriving pregnant , close to the delivery and very disturbed . With the beginning of the war , two young men of the group move back to Germany to join the Nazi forces . After the war , the place becomes a meeting point for Nazi sympathizers , giving support to former Nazis and assisting them to move to Argentina . Eurico ( Carlos Vereza ) , a Brazilian traveling salesman , arrives to the hotel and stays with the Kranz , expecting to be rewarded with hold for helping the Nazi sympathizers . Although awarded in many minor Brazilian Festivals , " Aleluia Gretchen " is a boring movie . Due to the long period covered by the story for the running time of 118 minutes , and the great number of characters , most of them badly developed , the screenplay is very confused . I am a great fan of Brazilian cinema , but I was completely disappointed with this film . Title ( Brazil ) : " Aleluia Gretchen " ( " Hallelujah Gretchen " )
454398	11228318	32439	6.0	Elmer's Candid Camera provides amusing preview of Elmer and Bugs relationship	This early cartoon directed by Charles M . Jones ( better known as Chuck Jones ) features the first appearance of the short's title character with the voice and facial features though he's a little heavier here and still has traces of his predecessor , Egghead . His nemesis is a rabbit who looks a little like Bugs Bunny except his face is pink and he sounds more like Goofy with a laugh like Woody Woodpeckeer ( no surprise since Mel Blanc also did that bird during this time ) . Elmer's trying to take wildlife pictures but keeps getting pranked on by the rabbit . A pretty amusing dry run for the hunting pictures started by Tex Avery's A Wild Hare , this cartoon should be seen at least for historical value . It's on disc 3 of The Looney Tunes Golden Collection , Vol . 1 .
517823	1132073	119468	10.0	Kiss the Girls !	Kiss the Girls is an excellent thriller ! It has very good acting by cast ! Morgan Freeman was great and Ashley Judd was very good ! Brian Cox was good as well ! I thought Cary Elwes was something else ! The other cast members Alex McArthur , Tony Goldwyn , Jay O . Sanders , and Richard T . Jones were good . Is it Me or did he try to act and sound like Denzel Washington ? Any way the movie is good and focuses on a great character named Alex Cross ! In case you don't know there is another film that Morgan Freeman reprises his role as Alex Cross and its called Along Came A Spider ! It is My favorite of the two but I am not saying that there is anything wrong with Kiss the Girls which is an excellent movie ! I recommend you see both films !
518636	8239592	63663	9.0	A strange , haunting and poignant drama about the shallowness of suburbanite existence	Burt Lancaster gives a strikingly fine , vibrant and touching performance as Ned Merrill , a washed-up , delusional middle-aged former ladies ' man failure who embarks on a bizarre journey of self-discovery by swimming through his affluent Conneticut neighbors ' pools while en route back to his house . Among the folks Ned meets during his peculiar pilgrimage are Kim Hunter as the perky , flirtatious wife of an old friend , Janet Landgard as a sweet , but sexy and enticing young woman , Diana Muldaur as a cheery divorcée , Dolph Sweet as a proud , boastful home owner , Joan Rivers as a raucous drunk , and , in an especially bravura turn , Janice Rule as Ned's bitter , snappish ex-mistress . Each individual encounter offers further sad insight into Ned's lonely and dismal misspent life . Deftly directed by Frank Perry , perceptively written by Eleanor Perry ( the script is based on a John Cheever short story ) , gorgeously shot in sparkling color by David L . Quaid , elegantly scored to beautifully lulling melancholic perfection by Marvin Hamlisch , and exceptionally well-acted by a first-rate cast , this wonderfully offbeat and moody allegory about the misery , snobbery , isolation , superficiality and shallow materialism of upper-class American suburbanite existence as well as the inevitability of getting older and the subsequent loss of youth packs a remarkably potent and poignant punch .
408001	865972	192731	3.0	Urban Legends : Final Crap .	At Alpine University , a group of film students are competing for the Hitchcock Award , a prestigious contest that would virtually guarantee anyone's career in Hollywood . Inspired by some stories from the campus security guard , Amy decides to create a film about urban legends-scary tales passed from person to person that everyone has heard . But soon after her movie starts filming , mysterious murders based on those very legends begin to plague the campus , and it's up to Amy and her friends to uncover the killer before it's too late . " Urban Legends : Final Cut " is another horrible teen slasher flick aimed at the younger audience . It's completely unoriginal and predictable . There are just long stretches of useless filler dialogue , interrupted by murders , shown in abstract , lackluster ways-two of them are shown through the eyes of cameras and two take place off-screen . The unmasking of the killer is a total let down and her / his motive is painfully stupid . There is a bit of gore and some stalk and slash sequences are mildly effective , unfortunately " Urban Legends : Final Cut " is a big steaming pile of dung . Avoid it like the plague . My generous rating : .
482873	1293485	82146	5.0	Eh , it's all good	I don't know why , but I guess I was just desperate for a movie last night , so I went searching through my mom's collection and found Caveman . I noticed some unknown celebs like Dennis Quaid and Shelly Long with always famous beatle Ringo Starr . Well , I figured that I'd give this movie a shot , it didn't seem so bad . After watching this I have one thing to say to the writers : You are some sick mofo's ! Anywho , this was a harmless fun slap stick that I'm sure most could get a little laugh out of . What seems like a slight parody of Quest for Fire , Atoulk is a caveman who has a thing for his leader's wife , Lana , but she doesn't even notice him . When Atoulk is banished from the tribe , he and his friend Lan start a new tribe of dimwits who believe that Atoulk is the strongest of all . After a few failed attempts , he proves to save the day and falls for another cave lady . Well , Caveman is silly , but it's all in good fun , I don't think the makers of the film meant any harm to film , just looking for a good slap stick . Like I said , it's nothing special , but you might get a couple little laughs here and there . I'd rather stick to Encino Man though when it comes to comedic caveman movies , you know ?

573366	4532636	373469	8.0	A Great Vehicle for Robert Downey , Jr .	Robert Downey , Jr . gives a loose , hip and extremely likable performance in this loose , hip and extremely likable comedy thriller . Downey , Jr . may not be able to manage his personal life worth a damn , but he does manage to show unerring instincts in picking good movies , and he's frequently one of the best things about whatever movie he happens to be in . In " Kiss Kiss Bang Bang " he plays Harry , a petty thief who ends up in L . A . on a fluke auditioning for a part as a private detective in a movie . Fiction begins to blur into reality when he gets caught up in a murder plot and must do some real-life detective work of his own with the help of Gay Perry , a Hollywood agent and odd-jobber ( Val Kilmer ) and his childhood friend , Harmony ( Michelle Monaghan ) , who he meets up with by chance . The plot is fast and twisted ; we frequently can see no further ahead than the characters and so share the same emotions they do when the next development comes along . The writers of this film have fashioned a quick-witted screenplay full of throw-away zingers and outrageous scenarios that they , along with the actors and direction , help to make work . Keep a sharp eye while watching this film ; tiny little details of plot or even of the production design recur later , sometimes in important ways , sometimes as no more than inside jokes . And even that most dreaded of film conventions , the voice over narration , that usually makes me cringe , works very well here , mostly due to Downey , Jr . ' s hilarious delivery of it . So . . . . a fast-paced , funny and off-beat film with don't-sweat-it performances and a solid script . You could do much worse . . . . .
401662	7743887	699338	9.0	The Big Day	The final episode of the second ' Shelley ' series ended with our hero marrying Fran . Quite a few sitcoms have featured ' wedding ' episodes - ' Father Dear Father ' , ' Man About The House ' , ' Doctor In Charge ' , ' Please Sir ! ' and ' In Loving Memory ' to name but a few . This one is structured unusually in that scenes of Shelley and ' Bunter ' getting ready are inter cut with those showing his final night as a bachelor . Nothing too extraordinary happens - the friends get drunk and philosophically discuss marriage . Mrs . H and Shelley's mother spend the night at Fran's Dad's palatial house in Shropshire . Isobel's liberal attitude to life and free use of language ( describing her son as ' a little sod ' at one point ) clearly embarrass the host . Had the series ended here , this would have made a good conclusion . Our unemployed hero is now in full-time work as an advertising copywriter , has a child on the way , and is married to boot . Fortunately , high ratings kept the show on air for most of the ' 80's and beyond . Good to see minor characters such as nosey ' Miss Radcliffe ' in attendance at the wedding . Not much of Belinda Sinclair though . Top marks for Peter Tilbury for managing to avoid all the clichés prevalent in sitcom weddings - Shelley does not get covered in paint or fall down stairs and the best man does not lose the ring down the toilet . Funniest moment - Fran tells Shelley in church " I love you " and his reply is " This is no time for sentimentality ! " . If I'd said that at my wedding , I'd have spent the honeymoon in Casualty !

Elaborate special effects highlight this tale about two kids who release an imprisoned player trapped for decades in a supernatural board game . Story line is quite stupid , but this is so much fun to watch . Robin Williams does his thing . A young Kirsten Dunst is charming in this preview of her future talents . Rounding out this mish-mash of a cast are : Bebe Neuwirth , David Alan Grier , Bradley Pierce , Bonnie Hunt and Jonathan Hyde in a dual role . Special effects and sight gags are redeeming .
544813	562732	71577	8.0	A worthy adaptation of Fitzgerald's novel , with only the really necessary drawbacks .	The Great Gatsby is a book that is very much expected to be made into a movie , and has been adapted several times before this one . It is an intricate story that entails an enormous amount of meaning and significance to society , but the literary version is not one that is capable of being adapted into a film that can capture the entire effect , because so much of the quality of The Great Gatsby lies in the words that are used in the novel , the way things are described , the way people think , etc . This can never be completely transferred to film , and this version of Gatsby leaves out a huge amount of the language and even unnecessarily changes several important scenes . I have heard Robert Redford criticized for fitting the upper-class half of Gatsby's personality too closely and not capturing his darker side well enough , but this is a completely superficial argument . It's true that Redford looks right at home in Gatsby's mansion and his clothes and everything , but it's also true that he walks through the entire movie as though he's not quite sure where he is or how he got there and , above all , that he's nervous about something that he's done or is about to do . I can understand someone thinking that Redford doesn't look like a bad enough guy to play Gatsby , but if there is any problem with him portraying Gatsby's darker side , it's probably more a result of the fact that so much of his hidden dealings are hidden or removed from the film than any weakness on the part of Redford's performance or his appearance in the role . We see one suspicious phone conversation and we realize his intentions with Daisy and how he came to be where he is , but this is told rather than shown . Mia Farrow gives a satisfactory performance as Daisy , although she does not capture many of Daisy's characteristics from the novel , most importantly , I think , the stunning beauty of the sort that would cause a man like Gatsby to spend several years completely transforming his life and becoming filthy rich ( and becoming a criminal while he's at it ) , only to keep his mind occupied with thoughts of Daisy despite all his money and the fact that his ocean-side mansion is constantly crawling with celebrities and beautiful people . Daisy has to be a ridiculously beautiful woman to justify that kind of behavior , or else Gatsby would have to at least be a completely obsessive nutcase . Neither is true . Farrow's shortcomings as Daisy are hugely overshadowed , however , by the character of Tom Buchanan , who is changed from a ' hulking brute of a man ' in the novel to a tall and skinny guy who only has the slow intellect and harsh jealousy toward Gatsby from his character in the novel . Bruce Dern is hugely miscast in this role , but does a decent job going through the motions of his character , at least the verbal ones that he's given . Sam Waterson probably gives the best performance in the film as Nick Carraway , although there is something of an awkward feel with his character if only because he is the narrator in the film , telling the story through his own eyes , while in the film he is an external character and the vast majority of his internal thoughts are necessarily erased . More than the performances , however , there are some scenes that are changed from the novel that just shouldn't have been . I can understand changing or reducing a scene or some dialogue here and there ( although in the case of a classic novel like this , changing anything is almost always a dangerous proposition ) , but there were some scenes that were very important in the novel , either to the story or to the process of characterization or anything else , that were changed for no good reason and with no good affect . The introduction of the characters of Tom , Daisy and Jordan , and most importantly , Gatsby himself were enormously altered for the film , for no apparent reason . Tom has a self-involved introduction in the novel where he introduces himself to Nick by making a comment on his own success , Daisy and Jordan are introduced sitting carelessly in the gigantic living room at Tom and Daisy's house amidst an atmosphere the likes of which no film is likely to reproduce , and Gatsby , most of all , has a wonderful introduction where he is sitting talking to Nick at one of his parties , and Nick casually mentions that he has been invited by some man named Gatsby that he's never met or even seen . Gatsby looks at him in surprise , saying , ' I'M Gatsby . ' This is the perfect way to introduce Gatsby as a man with the means to put on a social event of this caliber but without a clue in the moon about how to interact with his guests . Rather than this simple introduction , however , Nick is approached by one of Gatsby's servers and asked to come upstairs . This is a creepy scene which makes Nick feel nervous as though he's in trouble ( which is understandable since the man who approached him won't say a word and gives him a sly smile here and there as though Nick's the enemy and he's being taken prisoner by the mob boss ) . Nick gets upstairs and Gatsby is standing alone in a room looking out over his party , and there follows a creepy scene in which Gatsby stumbles over his words trying to introduce himself , and no a scrap of his joviality is captured from the novel . In the book , Gatsby is a man who doesn't know the social rules of his parties but is glad to have a grand old time with Nick even though they'd never met , while in the movie he nervously stumbles through plans to go out boating the next day , leaving Nick to stand there still not quite sure what he's supposed to do . I watched this version of The Great Gatsby just after watching the 1993 version of The Secret Garden , which is a film that takes a magical novel and makes a wonderful film out of it , but only really captures the basics of it , the necessary parts that are needed to have the film present the story and make sense . This version of The Great Gatsby is similar in that it is an enjoyable film that captures the story of the novel , but because of the richness of the language used in the book and some of the things that were , for some reason , changed for no apparent reason other than to be different from the original text , it doesn't capture the same experience as the novel .
579100	583640	148655	8.0	Early Flip the Frog-excellent cartoon !	This is one of the first half-dozen or so shorts from Iwerks and is exceptional . Flip is actually interesting and has a personality-what happened later on ? There's a discernable plot-not Shakespeare , but decent enough . The music ( not all Ragtime , but why quibble ? It's good ) is a primary component , the characters are well-executed and it's just an all-around success . If Iwerks had produced more shorts like this , the character ( and the studio ) would have been more successful . Great cartoon , good to see it in print , available on DVD . Well worth watching . Most recommended .
452971	15896852	24264	7.0	Litttle Big Women	The film might be more accurately titled " Little Woman " , with Katherine Hepburn seizing the lead role , and never letting go . Otherwise , it's the story of four " Little Women " growing up , and finding love's direction . Hepburn ( she's Jo ) is sister to Joan Bennett ( she's Amy ) , Jean Parker ( she's Beth ) , and Frances Dee ( she's Meg ) . Of their suitors , Douglass Montgomery ( he's Laurie ) gets the most action . Ms . Bennett steals the actual acting honors with a performance that is natural and consistent ; her voice and mannerisms are appropriately girlish , young womanish ? and , selfish . Ms . Hepburn plays girlish like she's had too many cups of coffee ; additionally , she never looks even remotely " tomboyish " ; looking , instead , like a ravishingly made-up MGM movie star . Ms . Parker rises out of her sick bed like a zombie , but is okay in other scenes . Watching Hepburn being romanced by Mr . Montgomery and Paul Lukas is unnerving . The story does have some reasons to watch , however . The production is obviously top-of-the-line . Hepburn may not be in her best role , but it's not awful ; she slows down and gets better after her character grows older . The script has well-written characters - Jo , Amy , and Laurie - who illustrate a sweet story of family , love , and friendship . Little Women ( 1933 ) George Cukor - Katharine Hepburn , Joan Bennett , Douglass Montgomery
400937	7743887	86819	1.0	Supermarket From Hell	We shall never know what made Leonard Rossiter agree to star in this feeble Thames sitcom . It certainly couldn't have been the quality of the scripts . Though penned by Brian Cooke , one half of the writing team behind ' Man About The House ' and ' George & Mildred ' , they proved about as funny as anthrax . The show cast Rossiter as ' Norman Tripper ' , the permanently harassed manager of a supermarket whose staff are either lazy or incompetent . Typical of the show's level of humour is the fact that two characters are named ' Laurel ' and ' Hardy ' so that Tripper can make a reference to ' Laurel & Hardy ' the comedy duo . As Tripper , its easily Rossiter's least distinguished comedy performance , though this is not his fault . Tripper comes across as a weak ' Basil Fawlty ' clone , constantly shouting his not very funny lines to no avail . Midway through the transmission of this series , Rossiter passed away , making ' Tripper's Day ' his last ever work for television . Shame . He deserved a better epitaph than this .
519311	8239592	78166	8.0	An excellent and unjustly overlooked 70's drive-in gem	A surprisingly taut and involving 70's B picture sleeper which has undeservedly slipped through the cracks and into obscurity . Gid Barker ( coolly played with firm inner resolve by Glenn Corbett ) , a fiercely self-reliant nonconformist loner Vietnam veteran , returns after a two year tour of duty to his jerkwater hometown of Benton , Florida to meet a decidedly chilly and unwelcoming committee that's more like a lynch mob . Back in the day Gid was a hell-raising womanizing troublemaker , so the guys in town are eager to put the thumbscrews to him . Gid winds up killing a man in self-defense when one dude picks a fight with him in a bar . Gid steals a souped-up pink Plymouth Fury and with his loyal , laid-back Native American pal Ray ( affable Doug Van ) and old flame Shirley ( sweet Ivy Jones ) in tow goes on the lam . The dead man's vengeful father ( a stern , steely Morgan Woodard ) forms a posse ( the always welcome Bill Thurman as an odious racist deputy among ' em ) to track Gid down . Gid in turn opens up a king-sized barrel of pure destruction on the seething , hateful little backwards hamlet . Skillfully directed by Robert J . Emery , this exciting and resolutely tough-minded winner packs an unexpectedly powerful punch , thanks to David Hall's compact , incisive script , a strikingly unflattering portrait of hicksville heartland America as a resentful hotbed of repressive toe-the-line conformity ( Gid's refusal to go along in order to get along makes him a much despised and ridiculed pariah ) , Vic Caeser's jaunty country and western score , complexly drawn characters , thrilling outbursts of deftly staged action , Jack Richards ' solid cinematography , across-the-board aces acting , and a painfully on-target " you can't go home " central message . A fine , gritty and shamefully neglected drive-in gem .
498278	1355507	167190	7.0	Very enjoyable comic book hero adaptation thing .	Hellboy starts in 1944 off the coast of Scotland where some evil Nazi's are conducting experiments in the black arts to try & tip the war in the favour of Hitler , with the help of Grigori Rasputin ( Karel Roden ) who tries to open a portal way to hell in order to unleash demons from another dimension . However Professor Trevor ' Broom ' Bruttenholm ( John Hurt ) & allied forces manage to stop them but not before a small red boy like creature enters our world through the portal , this small red creature grows up to become Hellboy ( Ron Pearlman ) who now works for the US Government in a secret organisation called the Bureau for Paranormal Research & Defense who monitor & combat supernatural & demonic threats to the Earth . Upon investigating a monster at a museum the team find out that Grigori is back & intends to destroy the world by reopening the portal & finishing what he started in 1944 . . . Written & directed by Guillermo del Toro one has to say I think Hellboy is easily one of the , if not the best comic book adaptation of the recent CGI computer effects stuffed years . First of all Hellboy is one of those frustrating films which is available in it's original theatrical version & a ' director's cut ' , now I know Hellboy wasn't the first & won't be the last but I am sick of Hollywood studios treating us film fans like idiots & trying to milk as much money out of us as possible . Why two different versions ? The director's cut only adds 10 minutes to a film which lasts over two hours anyway so the differences aren't likely to be significant , it just annoys me that studios are so cynical in knowing that the fans want the best version & will probably end up buying both & the studio ends up making more money from us , true film fans . Anyway , rant over . The character of Hellboy originally appeared in a series of Dark Horse graphic novel books & was created by Mike Mingola , with the success of other comic book adaptations like Spider-Man ( 2002 ) in particular the powers that be decided to make a Hellboy film & a fine film it is too . Even though it lasts for two hours it didn't feel that long , it moves along at a really good pace & your never too far away from a monster , a fight , an explosion or some other action set-piece . Also another factor which makes Hellboy work so well is that it's fun , it doesn't take itself too seriously & it just wants to entertain you which as far as I'm concerned it did in style . The character's are surprisingly good , Hellboy himself is pretty likable although one has to say beyond all the flashy effects , the action & the unique central character there's not that much else here , there certainly isn't much of a story to get involved in . Keep watching after the end credits start , once the big orange ones finish we discover that the makers hadn't forget Manning after all , it doesn't really say what happens to him but at least he gets a mention . Director del Toro made Hellboy straight after another comic book flick Balde II ( 2002 ) which is actually a better film than Hellboy because it's darker & has more of a story . Here del Toro was obviously under instruction to turn in a PG rated family film & therefore it's relatively restrained in the violence department . I will say that the film looks gorgeous though , the wonderful high tech sets of the bureau to the dark & dirty New York sewer system to the wonderful looking Gothic castles when the film switches to Russia to the costumes & in particular the Nazi assassin Kroenen with his sleek black metal mask & blades which shoot out of his sleeves . Hellboy looks fabulous in more ways than one because Hellboy the film looks great as does Hellboy the character brought to life by Rick Baker & his team as they applied the make-up to Pearlman which took fours hours everyday . The CGI computer effects also look brilliant , when done poorly CGI effects look awful but when done properly they are simply amazing & Hellboy is a good case in point , from monsters with swaying tentacles to explosions the CGI is top notch . With a supposed budget of about $66 , 000 , 000 Hellboy's budget was probably kept down due to the fact there weren't any really big stars in it demanding a $10 , 000 , 000 plus pay-cheque , I'd imagine most of that money actually ended up on screen & it shows because Hellboy does look the business . Surprisingly shot in Prague in the Czech Republic although actually set in America , Russia & Scotland . The acting is good but most of the human cast are given little to do , Pearlman steals the show here . Hellboy is a really fun , action & CGI computer effects packed comic book hero adaptation which in my humble opinion is maybe the best of the recent superhero films & better than Spider-Man at any rate . A must for fantasy film fans & fans of the graphic novels , very enjoyable on a big dumb loud noisy fun type of level . Look out for the forthcoming sequel Hellboy II : The Golden Army ( 2008 ) .
406771	865972	93628	7.0	Sleazy fun .	Melody , Marci and Mickey are three geeky and unpopular college girls who can't get a date . One night , they invite three geeky college guys over and have a seance that results in the girls becoming possessed by a succubus and turning into sex starved vamps . The madness ensues . . . The plot of " Nightmare Sisters " is mainly an excuse to show tons of nudity provided by three American Scream Queens Linnea Quigley , Michelle Bauer and Brinke Stevens . This film is impossible to take seriously as it's loaded with corny dialogs and cheap special effects . The acting is rather atrocious , but you'll laugh until it hurts with this one . So invite some friends , drink tons of beer and enjoy this amusing little horror flick . .
554613	1406078	365125	6.0	A head injury !	The perverts have invaded the neighborhood and we're not going to take it anymore ! Gays and lesbians are everywhere as well as all kinds of disgusting lewd behavior . Well , what are the righteous citizens to do ? Organize and try to get rid of them , but they're outnumbered ! Thus seems to be the premise for this hysterical John Waters picture . The promise for an irreverent take on pornography in suburbia dissolves as soon as it starts . Mr . Waters shows a milder side to himself , as it's been the case in his latest movies . But with that said , even a minor Waters is a hilarious one . Sure , the jokes get a bit stale , but the film has so many funny situations that anyone with an open mind will appreciate this kind of humor . Tracey Ullman blends the perfect amount of seriousness and insanity playing her Sylvia Stickles , the woman who comes alive as she is hit in the head ! Her scene at the nursing home playing the Hokey Pokey will become a classic Waters moment . Chris Isaak , Selma Blair , Suzanne Shepherd and Johnny Knoxville are also good .
370112	2488512	810823	6.0	Promising and Intriguing Beginning , Weak and Very Disappointing Explanation	In England , Ian Stone ( Mike Vogel ) finds himself trapped in a weird situation : everyday , he meets the same persons in the most different situation , including Medea ( Jaimie Murray ) and Jenny ( Christina Cole ) ; around 5 PM , the watches stop and Ian is haunted by creepy beings with claws and has a painful death , waking again in another life . When an old man meets him and tells that he must protect Jenny to resurrect again , Ian begins to unravel a great mystery . " The Deaths of Ian Stone " has a promising and intriguing beginning that recalls " Groundhog Day " , " 12 : 01 " and " The Matrix " , with the lead character awaking every day in a different reality after dying . Unfortunately the explanation of the Harvesters is weak and very disappointing . There are many points that deserve better clarification , like why the existence of parallel lives ? Or how can the realities change and how could Ian return to the initial life if he died ? With a better development of the story , resolving the flaws in the screenplay , this movie could be excellent . But it entertains and is original and my vote is six . Title ( Brazil ) : " Prisioneiro da Morte " ( " Prisoner of the Death " )
512922	3223254	379265	7.0	Confessions and Sequelae	OUTING RILEY may feel a bit self serving , as though Bobby Riley , the main character of the film , is sitting in a Confessional Booth revealing his secret , and in fact that is certainly the case as the film was conceived , lived , written , directed and stars Pete Jones as Bobby . This may account for some of the awkward sense of some of the dialog : it is difficult to be up front about an issue with a history as embedded as the theme of this film . But despite these minor flaws , this little film has a heart of gold and a cast of actors who bring it to life in a good way . Bobby Riley ( Pete Jones ) is an Irish Catholic closeted gay man living in Chicago with his partner Andy ( Michael McDonald ) . Bobby is being pressured by Andy and by his informed sister Maggie ( Julie Pearl ) to come out to his family - a good Irish Catholic family of four brothers , a sister , and a dying father ( Bob Riley ) . His facade with his brothers is a mime of voyeurism of ' chicks ' and a beer drinking butch life . Each family member has a secret : Maggie can't hold a relationship and is unable to keep secrets ; Connor ( Stoney Westmoreland ) is addicted to internet porn ; Jack ( Dev Kennedy ) is a priest who has problems with the conflicts the church places on his own beliefs ; Luke ( the always outstanding Nathan Fillion ) is a pothead . Once Maggie decides she must out Bobby , the brothers are conflicted : homophobia raises its ugly head despite the bonds of close family ties . How the family comes to grips with Bobby's being gay , individually and as a family , is the crux of the tale . This is a fine cast ( especially Fillion and Pearl ) and the story rolls along at a fine pace . At times it feels ' dishonest ' but that is in the script , not the acting . This is not a major film , but it just may be a helpful one to families and friends who are curious about the lifestyle of someone who has surprised them with a similar secret ! Grady Harp
521312	1162550	59753	8.0	A brief glimpse of what might have been	Captain Christopher Pike ( Jeffrey Hunter ) heads the U . S . S . Starship Enterprise in this pilot that the Powers that Be passed on , forcing Gene Rodenberry to make a second pilot with Wialliam Shatner as Kirk as well as making the new version more action oriented , less cerebral and ditching the idea of a woman as second in command . But that would all come later as this review is on the topic at hand . The unaired pilot deals with Pike being held captive in a glass cage by alien beings who possess the powers of mind illusions . It's in both black & white , as well as color ( the parts that would be lated integrated into " The Menagerie " 2-part episode of Star Trek ) It's more thought-provoking , less " action-packed " then the later series would end up being . And I throughly enjoyed it . This original version can be found as an extra on the Season 3 DVD set of Star Trak by the way .
559130	2626332	91474	3.0	Red Dragon was way way better .	As the much-touted initial installment of the " Hannbal Lecter " series , this movie really did not impress me . Again , I stand against the flow of the mighty river that is public opinion , but I felt the portrayal by Cox as " Leckter " was shallow , superficial , and otherwise lacked the intensity generated by Anthony Hopkins . The part of Graham was also better portrayed in the Red Dragon remake . While it was well played here , it was much better done in Red Dragon , as it created an electrifying feeling , and generated that wonderful suspense I had come to expect from these movies , and did not get . . . with this one . Also , there is present , one of the most horribly distracting musical scores in the history of theater , aside from 2001 : A Spade Odyssey . The worst case for music and its affects on an audience , play out well here . This was horrid , and succeeded in killing whatever mood the scene had managed to achieve . For this movie to be so highly praised by horror fans , I was sorely disappointed . While the scenes and dialog play out pretty much exactly as they did in Red Dragon , this production was by far , inferior to the remake . The sets were poorly and cheaply designed , the performances were sub-par to what I experienced with the remake , and the story ( while compelling ) moved along far too slowly for my taste . There are times when a slow-moving story can generate that wonderful level of suspense , create an air of mystery and tension which is so needed in these movies of the psychological sub-genre . This attempt failed to create much of anything with its slow build-up for me , besides boredom with the whole first half of the movie , and frankly , by the time I muddled through the first uneventful portion , I really did not care wither or not they caught the " Tooth Fairy , " killed Graham and his family , or succeeded . If you are a horror fan , see this movie . It is , after all , the movie which spawned Silence of the Lambs , Hannibal , and the prequel remake Red Dragon . But that is , honestly , the only reason to see it . It is dated , slow and rather a " B " production all around . This rates a on the " B " scale . That's a on the " A " scale , from . . . the Fiend : .
555099	1406078	26129	7.0	South of the border	Archie Mayo's " Bordertown " is a film that by today's standards would be deemed politically incorrect . The idea of the poor Mexican immigrant that wants to better himself , only to see people step all over him , is at the center of this tale . Juan Ramirez , the young lawyer , trying to defend the victim of an accident caused by the young and reckless Dale Elwell , is defeated by a much more experienced Anglo lawyer , who happened to know the system and the judge , obviously . As a result , Juan , decides to leave L . A . to go to a border town , probably Tijuana , where he becomes a partner of Charlie Roark , a decent man who sees the potential in Johnny , as he calls himself now . What Charlie doesn't know is that he is married to a scheming woman that couldn't care less for him . She has to get rid of her husband in order to get her hands on his money and looks to Johnny to help her , but of course , he wants nothing to do with her . Paul Muni was a great star at Warner Bros . at the time of this film . We were never fans of Mr . Muni , who in this film gives a clichéd account of the Hispanic Juan in a performance that goes over the top and doesn't convince anyone . On the other hand , Bette Davis , as Marie Roark , is her usual excellent self in a more nuanced performance . We see why later on , Ms . Davis will use all what she shows in this film and more to be the great star that she was . In minor roles , the formidable Eugene Palette plays Charlie Roark and Margaret Lindsay is seen as Dale Elwell , the rich girl that provoked the accident . This film is a rarity seldom seen these days .
450687	2093818	342272	8.0	Better than I expected	When I first heard of this film , I didn't think it would be much of a worthwhile experience . . . few Danish film productions are worth watching . Of course , then I was told that it was directed by Thomas Vinterberg . . . who directed Festen . . . and written by Lars von Trier , who's responsible for some of the greatest Danish productions . The plot may not sound impressive at first ( it certainly didn't to me . . . and I'm a gun freak ) , but it develops very nicely and holds your interest for the entire running time . I wasn't bored for a second , really , which also says a lot about the ( high ) quality of the pacing . The acting is excellent all-round . Not one performance is even slightly disappointing . The score is magnificent . Plenty of The Zombies , and it both sounds great and fits well . The direction is excellent , and nicely ( not to mention subtly ) stylish . Near the end , there are some effective insert shots . The writing is of equally high quality . . . there are some incredibly good observations and very interesting themes in the film . One thing I had a bit of a problem with in this film ( and pretty much the reason it's getting an 8 , not a 10 ) is the typically poor Danish humor . It didn't get as much as a smile from me , and it ruined several potentially strong scenes ( there do remain quite a few strong scenes , though ) . It just didn't help the film any , it just made it slightly harder to endure . The other thing here is , the film moves somewhat slow for the duration . . . it's a character study with simple plot , and a great one at that , but there could easily been a faster pace without losing too much of that quality ( plus , one of the main characters , Freddie , could have been cut out of the film with no real loss ) . The film gets truly entertaining , downright fun to watch at the end ; I won't say how or why in case someone reading this hasn't seen the film yet , but let me tell you , it's a blast to watch , and it's a great , no , scratch that ; an astoundingly great payoff to the major setup the film up to that point really becomes when this portion starts . The last thing that bothers me about this film is how ( over - ) critical it is of America and the US gun policy . Lars von Trier ( who , like another reviewer points out , has never set foot in the US ) is very critical of America , and his views and opinions on the country as expressed in this film are skewed and quite in contrast with reality . It's as if he was creating satire with this film . . . but judging from the last scene , it was rather ( as yet another reviewer points out ) propaganda . A well-written and nicely directed film that most people should watch , but one should not look at this for a realistic portrayal of America . I recommend this to fans of drama , any of the actors and either or both of the film-makers , Vinterberg and von Trier . People who are ignorant of what the US is actually like should take care to understand that this film was made by someone who has a very stereotypical , highly negative and ( most importantly ) quite wrong view of the country . Still , an interesting piece of film , and one I wouldn't mind watching again .
513671	3223254	412080	10.0	A Beautiful , Touching , Entertaining Tale of Dreams and Aging	It seems many viewers avoided this film when it was in the theaters because the title was confusing and not representative of the story . The fact that Sir Anthony Hopkins was the lead actor should have been a signal of sorts , but it took the release of the DVD for this viewer to reluctantly rent the film when other possibilities were low . Big Mistake ! This is one of the more genuinely fine films about the idomitability of the human spirit that has been released in some time . Based on a true story , the ' Indian ' of the title has nothing to do with the heritage of the character Burt Munro , a 67 year old odd but generously kind New Zealander whose lifelong passion is to race his 1923 ' Indian motorbike ' in the Bonneville Salt Flats Races in America . Burt lives for his dreams and despite the fact that his idiosyncrasies befuddle his neighbors and townsfolk ( with the except of the little boy Tom next door who idolizes him ) , he manages to make everyone with whom he comes into contact admire , and yes , love him . Using his own skills he brings his old motorbike to the point that he can enter the race in the States and with the financial help of his friends he manages to board a ship with his bike and sail to America . In the US he is a fish out of water and must adjust to the city life and attitudes of the Americans , but eventually , through his innate charm and dedication to his dream , he does manage against all odds and , with the help of many American new friends , enter the race to break the world's record for speed on a motorbike . Hopkins owns the role of Burt and despite his not always on target New Zealand accent he manages to deliver surely one of his most endearing portrayals of his rich career . His encounters with Tom , with a feisty widow Ada ( Diane Ladd ) , with a fine old wise Indian man , and with a transsexual motel clerk Tina ( Chris Williams ) , to name only a few of the superb supporting cast - are the epitome of underplayed fine acting and engender so much warmth that tears of happiness just can't be avoided . Writer and director Roger Donaldson deserves a standing ovation for this small , sensitive , gentle , understated tale that demonstrates so well how being true to your visions and your dreams can overcome almost any obstacle . A deeply touching and completely entertaining movie . Highly Recommended for all audiences . This is one to Buy ! Grady Harp
513044	3223254	418819	2.0	Obviously there is an audience for this product . . . .	George A . Romero enters with yet another installment in his banal and grossly visual zombie flicks and hopefully this will be the last of them . Obviously there is an appreciative audience who enjoys watching partially decomposed bodies stomp around and grunt and eat body parts of the living because a lot of people write positively about this film . For this viewer the ' parody ' eludes . LAND OF THE DEAD is simply a dark , grotesque , poorly written , hastily thrown together bit of treacle to make money off the folks who like this genre . But how fine actors like Simon Baker , John Leguizamo , Dennis Hopper , Asia Argento , and Robert Joy agree to the casting agent's invitation to star in this film is a conundrum . Grady Harp
492834	3280905	20640	10.0	Hooray For Captain Spaulding , the African Explorer	The first two surviving Marx Brothers films were based on their second and third major Broadway successes : THE COCONUTS and ANIMAL CRACKERS . As early movies they suffer from the rigidity of the early talkies . Papers used as props on the set had to be wet in order for the crackling of paper to be reduced as much as possible from being picked by the microphones . It is remarkable that the films survived to continue to bring pleasure to audiences . In the case of ANIMAL CRACKERS , for years it and the later A NIGHT IN CASABLANCA were tied up in copy-write problems that prevented them being released to the public . I did not see it until I went with my sister to see the film in 1974 in Manhattan . This film is the one that established Groucho Marx's theme song , " Hooray For Captain Spaulding . " Groucho's Jeffrey T . Spaulding has just returned from Africa , and has been invited to the Long Island estate of Mrs . Rittenhouse ( Margaret Dumont ) . Her guests include the noted art collector and expert Roscoe W . Chandler ( Louis Sorin ) . He's going to reveal a masterpiece of art that he has purchased . Mrs . Rittenhouse's " friend " and rival Mrs . Whitehead plans to steal the painting , and hide it to embarrass her hostess . Her daughter and her ex-butler Hives ( Robert Greig ) are in on this plot . Meanwhile Mrs . Rittenhouse's daughter Arabella ( Lillian Roth ) is trying to help her boyfriend John Parker ( Hal Thompson ) , a struggling artist prove his abilities . Other guests include the musician , Signior Emmanuel Ravelli and the Professor ( Chico and Harpo ) and Spaulding's secretary Horation Jamison ( Zeppo ) . There are many similarities between this musical's book and THE COCONUTS , such as both having detectives named Hennesey , and both naming Zeppo Jamison . The struggles of Roth standing by her struggling painter-boyfriend mirror the struggles of Mary Eaton supporting her struggling architect-boyfriend Oscar Shaw . But here Groucho is a visitor , not the hotel owner / manager . And here there is more use for Zeppo . In fact , except for the third film ( MONKEY BUSINESS ) and the fifth film ( DUCK SOUP ) , Zeppo never had as much to do that was funny in any of the Marx Brothers movies than here . He has to take dictation from Groucho regarding the legal team of Hungerdunger , Hungerdunger , Hungerdunger , Hungerdunger , and McCormick ( pronounced " Hoongerdoonger " ) . It is a classic Marx routine . There are some topical humor . Roscoe W . Chandler is a spoof on the noted millionaire and culture maven Otto Kahn , head of the Board of the Metropolitan Opera . Kahn was trying to find a location for the new opera house in the late 1920s , and we hear Chandler and Groucho discussing possibly putting it into Central Park . Kahn was from the old Wilhelmine Empire , and was an immigrant ( though one who made good in banking ) . Chandler , in one stunning moment with Chico , turns out to be Abe Kabible , a fish peddler from Czechoslovakia ( Chandler has to pay some blackmail to Chico and Harpo about this , but he does shoot back at Chico an inquiry of how long he's been an Italian ! ) . Another topical jab is regarding Eugene O'Neill's STRANGE INTERLUDE , where O'Neill had characters speak their minds separately from the regular dialog with each other . In fact , Groucho even admits he is going into a strange interlude of his own . His comments are spoken in a clipped , sad voice , and include a final set of lines where he sounds portentous - talking about strange figures , weird figures . Then he starts giving stock quotations ! The film is a little slow at spots , as was THE COCONUTS , but the brothers do well , as does Lillian Roth and Margaret Dumont . The film is very entertaining , and it is good that it is still around .
585599	783721	166924	6.0	I only have one good thing to say about this flick . . .	. . . and that's " Naomi Watts " . Lynch , in an apparent effort to stretch , appears to becomes obsessive about this noir nonsense which by all accounts is a huge movie but which exit polls at theaters would probably reveal to be a loser . Bottom line , I about fell asleep from boredom as Lynch took his own sweet time pulling together the pieces of a jig-saw puzzle which develops into just so much excessive silliness . On the up side Watts turns in a stellar performance and Lynch limps along with no big names . On the down side is everything else : No characters we can identify or empathize with ; no hero or anyone we can care about ; a shoddy convoluted plot which just gets more ridiculous as time wears on ; etc . . yadayadayada . Bottom line , this movie sucked except for the titillating nude chicks making out part which only engages the limbic system . Hype = boxoffice and , as with " Memento " , most moviegoers will have trouble understanding what this flick was about and why they should care . Recommended only for film fanatics , critics , dilettantes , and the like .
578834	583640	42836	8.0	Nothing really new about this one , but it's a Tex Avery !	The basic themes and elements are nothing new-it's basically The Shoemaker and the Elves revisited . But Tex Avery had a tendancy to take the conventional and stretch and twist it into something quite odd indeed ! This is not your grandfather's fairy tale ! Chuck Jones once quoted Rafael Sabbatini to describe Tex Avery and I'll close with that here : He was born with the gift of laughter and a belief that the world was mad . That , my friends , I submit , is a description of genius and fits Tex Avery quite well . Well worth watching . Most recommended .
452575	15896852	45883	5.0	Turn of the Page	After encountering rampaging Apache Indians , John Wayne ( as Hondo Lane ) and his dog lick their wounds at Geraldine Page ( as Angie Lowe ) ' s ranch . The plain Ms . Page is waiting for her husband to return ; however , she and manly Mr . Wayne are attracted to each other . Wayne teaches Page's boy Lee Aaker ( as Johnny ) how to swim . Page thinks Apache Michael Pate ( as Vittorio ) and his Indians are nice , but Wayne considers them savages . No points for guessing who is right . Colorful western action , with some " in-your-face " moments , since " Hondo " was originally filmed for 3-D . The film winds up being far too glossy for its own good , however . The supporting cast is notably fun . Page has her first featured film role ; it's nowhere near her best work , but she received Academy Award consideration . Watch for the scene where Wayne tells her , " I'm part Indian and I can smell you when I'm downwind of you , " with Page seeming more comely than " homely " . Ward Bond , a grizzly Wayne film regular , is seem in relative good light . Mr . Pate and James Arness shine , in their Apache war paint ; Pate reprised his Apache role for the television series . And , Mr . Aaker and Tom Irish get to learn lessons in western drama .
421098	2542703	32410	5.0	Down Argentina Way - Horse Forioso But Film So-So	The singing and dancing are great . The plot is weak here with Argentinian , Don Ameche , with an authentic Spanish accent , romances Bette Grable . For some foolish reason , Ameche's father , an engaging Henry Stephenson , has it in for the Crawford family for an incident that took place long ago between him and Grable's father . Charlotte Greenwood portrays Grable's aunt to perfection . The only thing she will admit to is being 31 . She really kicks up her heels as does the rest of the cast . Carmen Miranda portrays herself briefly in two dancing scenes . We can really say that she is wasted here . There is another gem of a performance by J . Carrol Naish , as a Spanish worker for Stephenson .
492470	3280905	68270	7.0	An interesting introduction to the works of Kurt Vonnegut ( thru 1972 )	When I went to college in the early 1970s the leading contemporary American novelists who were popular were Kurt Vonnegut and Richard Brautigan . Brautigan's TROUT FISHING IN America was very popular , but his subsequent writings failed to maintain his popularity . Not so Vonnegut , whose string of successes lasted far longer . I read SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE , GOD BLESS YOU MR . ROSEWATER , CAT'S CRADLE , THE SIRENS OF TITAN , MOTHER NIGHT , and the other books . So this particular television show really interested me . It was like a selection of episodes from the various novels and short stories of Vonnegut , hosted ( as news reporters ) by Bob Elliot and Ray Goulding . Goulding is reprising the role of " Walter Gesundheit " he played in a movie a few years earlier . Eliott is playing an astronaut ( like Wally Schirra , who frequently appeared with Walter Cronkite at space shots ) . They get bogged down trying to recall Neil Armstrong's first words upon the Moon surface . William Hickey played Stony Stevenson , the best friend of the hero in THE SIRENS OF TITAN . He is chosen to be the world's first time traveler , and we see him going from one place to another . Hickey meets Dr . Hoenikker / Hurd Hatfield ( creator of " Ice 9 " - and an example of the short sightedness of government sponsored science ) , and Bokonon / Kevin McCarthy ( the ultimately powerless religious leader ) from CAT'S CRADLE . He meets Wanda June from Vonnegut's play . He sees the threat of puritanical-ism mixed with inane political correctness in the future when he crosses the path of one woman vigilante Diane Moon Gompers . The show as an introduction to Vonnegut was very good . Parts of it were shot in Flushing Meadow Park , not far from my home . So I thoroughly enjoyed the program .
450302	2093818	354469	8.0	Entertaining , challenging and probably the best of the series	I remember reading about the original Commandos : Behind Enemy Lines in the late 90's . It sounded ludicrously difficult . I later borrowed the add-on , Beyond the Call of Duty , featuring eight new missions . I never played the original . . . however , the add-on certainly provided the difficulty that I gathered it featured . I remember spending hours just trying to get a little further . There would sometimes pass immense amounts of time where I didn't play it at all , due to the frustration and irritation this caused . But I kept playing . And by the time I had beaten it , I was wanting more . In 2001 , I finally got it . I bought this game as soon as I could and immediately started playing it . At first glance , it appears much easier than the previous two efforts . . . but upon closer inspection , that is simply a matter of difficulty settings ; the " easy " setting provides less challenge than that of the previous games , whereas the medium and hard ones are very much like it . The game is also much more entertaining than the first . You're given much more freedom , letting the player think for himself , working out the solutions . . . instead of merely spending enormous amounts of time trying out different things in an effort to figure out the method that the developers had planned for him to take . The graphics engine improves vastly , with better lighting , effects and a nifty ripple effect to show you how much noise you're making , when you're making any , at all . Several characters are added , all of which are quite useful . The Sapper , Green Beret , Diver , Sniper , Spy ( who can now control the direction of the enemy soldiers view and even tell them to walk a small distance , when distracting them ) and Driver all return from the first game , as well as their abilities ( along with some thoroughly welcome new ones ) , and a Thief , a dog named Whisky and a Russian woman named Natasha are added to the mix . The thief , apart from obviously , stealing ( from unsuspecting soldiers , those of them that have anything worth taking , such as keys and cigarettes ) and lock-picking ( some doors and crates ) , can hide just about anywhere as well as navigate with much more freedom ( climbing walls , for example ) , due to his slim physique . He moves faster as well as more silent than anyone else on the team . The only downside to him , really , is that he cannot tie up anyone he knocks out . Whisky is limited to being fairly close to his master ( which can be any of the commandos ) , and his bark will distract any guard in the vicinity ( though no one will hurt him ) . Natasha is basically another Spy , though she appears to have fewer abilities . She generally takes over when he can't be there , and appears within the mission . The Driver gets some traps and the ability to throw ( sleeping ) gas grenades , Molotov cocktails and smoke grenade . There are countless new features . . . among them , everyone can now disguise themselves as enemy soldiers ( though only for a limited time and with less effect than the Spy and Natasha ) , you can examine your surroundings . . . and the huge additions . . . height levels and interiors are added , as well as an inventory system . Remember the one-level , entirely exterior user interface of the previous game ? No more . Elevators and stairs will take you higher or lower , and you can see where you're swimming , when you dive ( and that opens up to new underwater hazards ; in fact , the Nazis aren't your only adversary this time . There are some Japanese , and occasionally animal / natural dangers ) , and you can now actually go in-doors . Previously , you could just hide commandos inside buildings , but now , you can actually explore them , making for much more elaborate and interesting campaign scenarios . The inventory allows you to pick up enemy weapons , find and trade equipment , including cigarettes and wine bottles ( which can be drugged , leaving the soldier who drinks unconscious ) for distraction and luring , as well as more grenades , traps and means of navigation ( such as rope ladders ) . Control is made more effective ; you can now attach your own shortcut keys to the various abilities of your commando teams , and pressing Shift while holding the mouse over an interactive object or enemy will often let you activate it . Like the other games , stealth is essential . I will admit that , on the easiest difficulty setting , it is entirely possible to beat the game without it . . . but there's little fun ( and no challenge ) in that , and unlike the third ( the first necessitated it ) , this provides an incentive for playing through properly . Your performance in each mission is judged , on such criteria as how long it took you to beat , how many areas you visited , how many enemies you neutralized . . . and how many of them were killed . Yes , this time around , you're strongly encouraged to leave as many enemies as you can bound and gagged . . . rather than dead . The better you do on a mission , the greater the chance of you being promoted ( since you play as a commander , an officer ) . The game is of a pretty fitting length . After two training missions which work nicely to introduce you to the game , new features and old alike , there are ten missions ( taking you to and through as exciting locations as the bridge over the river Kwai ( though sans the catchy whistling ) , the arctic and even Paris , where you get to travel to the top of the Eiffel tower ) and ten bonus missions ( all playable in the well-executed multi-player , as well , as soon as they have been beaten in single player ) . These bonus missions are made available through collecting puzzle pieces in the missions . . . collect the full puzzle ( an incentive to visit and search all areas ) , and you are taken directly to the bonus level after completing the current level . Completing a bonus level will award you a medal . Completing any level will grant you a short and visually impressive ( if somewhat cinematically bland ) cut-scene . The difficulty slowly but surely heightens for each new level . Entertaining , challenging and thoroughly well-done game . I recommend this strongly to any fan of stealth-games and / or RTS .
523794	4445210	104522	7.0	Here's An Odd Irish Tale	I always remember this movie for the shock of seeing a horse trying to live an apartment . Now , there's an unusual sight ! I revisited this film last week and for a second and an overdo " ride " with these mystical Irish gypsies and their strange . By the way , I hadn't realized how nicely filmed this was until I saw it on 1 . 85 : 1 widescreen DVD . Also to my surprise was that it wasn't the happy , family film I had remembered . There are many moments of frustration , sadness , violence , injustice , ete . It's hardly a bunch of fun times . The language is such , too , that I wouldn't recommend this for little kids , unless perhaps in Ireland where everyone seems to use Jesus ' name in vain frequently , even kids . It's still a story , basically , about two kids trying to capture and then keep a white horse , which is taken away from them . The cops ( some crooked , as filmmakers love to show ) , the crooks and family are all out over the countryside looking for the boys and the horse . In between , their father slowly comes to grips with the death of his wife some seven years earlier , a tragedy he has never been able to deal with correctly . The best character and the most fun to watch is little " Ossie , " played by Ciaran Fitzgerald . He's the one most-attached to the horse and the wee one has some of the best lines in the film .
559415	2626332	250310	8.0	Positively risible	Many critics have bashed this movie and Chris Kattan's talents herein . I personally found this movie completely bewitching . Corky Romano is a mama's boy who was sent to college while his two older brothers kept at home , working for " Pop . " Therefore Corky has an education and a promising career as a veterinarian , while his older brothers are nothing more than thugs for their mob-boss father . Upon the death of Corky's mother , the brothers kicked him out of the house and converted his room into a gym for themselves , leaving Corky on his own , but he appears to have done quite well for himself without any help from his " family . " But now , Dad ( Peter Falk as " Pops " Romano ) is in trouble with the FBI and now they want Corky to actually care what happens to them . Personally , I would have let them rot , but being the kind-hearted , sweet , and gentle soul that he is , he agrees to help by infiltrating the FBI with phony transfer documents and a lot of guts . His mission : To steal back the evidence files against Pops or his father could spend the rest of his very short life in prison . It sounds serious , and could have been , but Chris Kattan is absolutely jocose in his role as Corky Romano . I laugh every time I watch this movie . He is insightful , caring , and intelligent , if a bit nervous and spastic at times , but that is part of his charm . Some of these scenes will have you wiping the tears from your eyes from laughing so hard . This movie is a delightful fish-out-of-water story , and another of the Fiend's many favorites .

482636	1293485	110632	3.0	What the hell was Oliver thinking ? !	First off , this movie is a gigaintic music video . Very poor acting . And I didn't see Mallory as a sick twisted girl who just got treated unfairly in life . And Mickey was just plain stupid and sick . Both Mickey and Mallory were very sadistic and should of gotten killed in this movie . It could still be a good movie , but needs a lot of improvement .
548148	1111192	156706	3.0	Disregard the plot line given here , this is not really much of a zombie flick .	First of all this movie is not really Zombie 5 as someone pointed out Zombie 4 After Death came out a year later . Rather , both movies are just being repackaged and given new names simply to make some connection to Fulcio's Zombi 2 . The only thing they have in common is that the dead do rise . I liked After Death a little , I thought it was a nice little zombie flick , nothing super great , but worth a look . This one , however , was really kind of tedious . Started promisingly enough with a man going on a killing spree after he finds his wife in bed with another man , but then it almost turns into a teen flick as we are introduced to the rest of the cast . The music even makes it seem like a teen comedy . Oh , and though it really is not clear at all there has been a significant number of years that has passed since the killings . Well we meet our young group of bird watchers and one annoying bus driver and a rather unremarkable reporter and all you can think is I hope they all die in extremely horrible ways . Not a good way to establish your characters in a horror movie is it ? I mean when they aren't arguing over stupid stuff they are mumbling their lines so badly they sound like the parents in a Charlie Brown cartoon . Well they set off to find a bird which has not been seen in 20 or so years , and they run across a blind bird watcher . You'll know who he is and you will know what one of the gang of teens is right away so there is no real surprise at the revelation at the end . Well after they bother the blind guy they proceed to go bird watching get lost in the woods and find a house . They immediately set up camp here , despite the fact there vehicle is like just over the hill and if they would have continued searching for another 5 minutes they could have gotten out without anything happening . But hey , its a horror movie . Well finally some stuff starts to happen as people begin to die while their friends just stand there watching the person die . Of course they don't offer to help just standing there like idiots and then reacting well after the fact when it is far to late . My favorite being the guy who gets caught in a generator gear and gets ground up while this moron stands there not offering to help , then after the guy has had it he runs up stairs and says " they got him " . I had to say , no they didn't the jerk got caught and you kind of let him die . As for the zombies they aren't in this movie much and they don't make much of an impression . The plot is practically nonexistent as there is no explanation for why any of it is happening besides the blind man's explanation at the end . Then you expect a rather grisly conclusion , but it never materializes and it just ends . Not a real zombie movie I say the makers were trying to make a movie more in the vain of " The Beyond " . Of course that movie looks better , sounds better , and has better kills so there is no comparison there . I don't know maybe this was two movies that got bumped together . One film crew was making a horror movie , the other a teen romance , but they ran into each other and the teen romance people thought , a horror movie cool . That would explain the strange changes in the music in the first thirty minutes or so .
417390	663392	24831	10.0	Audiences Were Different in the 1930's !	Never viewed this film and consider it a great Classic with great veteran actors . In the period that this film was made , people in America were different , there was no TV or all the modern things we have today , except the Radio and the starting out of great films being made in Hollywood . Sweet innocent tales of young romance between a young girl or guy was viewed differently than it is today . Ann Shirley , " Murder My Sweet " , ' 44 played a young orphan gal who was called Carrot Top because of her red hair and found herself being taken into a home of two elderly folks , who were like two wise owls and watched over Ann Shirley . It was a small town and everyone knew everyone and if anything happened , the entire town found out about it within minutes . It is a down to earth film with nice decent people trying to help each other in a very very simple way of living . Today , it seems very corn ball and stupid , but believe me , this was the way people were in America during the 1920 ' . & 30's and they were a great generation that loved good family films .
405103	2020269	814685	8.0	French Kiss . . . . The Extreme Kind !	The French seemingly can't be beat when it comes to visceral , savage and in-your-face sadistic survival / torture porn flicks lately . Since " High Tension " skyrocketed the popularity of the horror genre in 2003 , this nation already delivered a couple of ultimately brutal movies that ? without the slightest form of exaggeration ? make U . S . films " Saw " and " Hostel " look like soft and sentimental Disney cartoons . The more or less simultaneously released " à l'intérieur " ( a . k . a . Inside ) thus far remains the absolute highlight of shocking controversy , but this " Frontière ( s ) surely ain't no Saturday afternoon picnic , neither . The rudimentary concept is a variation on the infamous mid-70's sub genre of ' Rednecksploitation ' . These films revolved on maniacal hillbillies terrorizing and butchering big city folks in rural areas far away from the civilized world and usually strictly for their own sheer entertainment . Considering the high population density all across the European continent , it would be pretty ridiculous to introduce unworldly rednecks and so Xavier Gens ' script cleverly replaces them with extremist cartels . There are several of those around here , including fanatic minions of Hitler's Nazi principles . The city of Paris is in complete chaos following the announcement of the election results , and a bunch of young thugs grabs this opportunity to commit a bank robbery and flee towards the French-Luxembourgian border . They arrive in a place far worse than the Parisian suburbs when checking into a hotel run by a deeply deranged family of Nazis . The family , led by an elderly patriarch who easily could have been one of Hitler's closest drinking buddies , need the girl for breeding reasons and subject the men to various games of sickening torture . Admittedly " Frontière ( s ) " sounds like a compilation of gratuitous gore and perverted characters , but writer / director Xavier Gens definitely had some more admirable ambitions . Extreme right-wing political parties unstoppably march forward in pretty much each European country ( in fact , their victory triggered the whole chain of events here ) , and Gens actually attempts to illustrate ? albeit quite vigorously ? what the consequences would be if they regain power one day . Anyway , you obviously shouldn't watch this movie for its valuable morality lesson , but rather because it vividly depicts hardcore violence and uncompromising cruelty . Unless you have nerves of steel and a properly insulated stomach , you might want to consider turning your head away from the screen most of the time . There's a truly nauseating massacre involving a mechanical band saw , various close range shotgun killings , slit throats , stabbed chest and one excruciatingly uncomfortable moment featuring pliers and someone's Achilles tendon . Yikes ! Vile , revolting and totally unnecessary ? Perhaps ? but definitely fascinating to behold . " Frontière ( s ) " suffers a bit from messy cinematography and limited imagery , but at the same time you could claim this also increases the primitive and savage atmosphere Gens intended to reflect . The film is definitely a bit too long for its own good ( 110 minutes of running time for a sickie film ? ) and some of the redundant sub plots and character drawings during the first half hour could easily have been cut . The make-up effects are simply great and Xavier Gens ' surefooted directing skills already bought him a one-way ticket to a promising career in Hollywood .
368551	2707735	27441	7.0	" Innocent grass may conceal snake . "	When favored race horse Avalanche loses a race due to his rider's foul , his owner Major Gordon Kent becomes suspicious , believing that a gambling syndicate may have been behind the rider's actions . Kent calls upon famed detective Charlie Chan ( Warner Oland ) for his involvement , and it's off to the races so to speak . Unfortunately Kent , who has come too close to identifying the conspiracy , winds up dead in Avalanche's stable aboard ship heading for Los Angeles . Number # 1 Son Lee Chan ( Keye Luke ) signs on as a cabin boy for the cruise ship to legitimize his presence , and quickly joins his " Pop " in the investigation . Charlie relies on Lee a bit more than we've seen in prior films , trusting him to drop phony threatening letters to the principals introduced in the film , which include Kent's son in law George Chester , now Avalanche's owner ; Warren Fenton , owner of rival horse Gallant Lad ; and gambler Denny Barton . When a fire in the hold of the ship is deliberately set to cause confusion , horse trainer Bagley switches the two horses . The tip off comes from an unlikely source - stable boy Streamline Jones has a pet monkey that favors Gallant Lad , but causes Avalanche to react violently . The ever observant Oriental Detective picks up on this immediately , and schemes to reverse the animals to their rightful identities before the day of the Santa Juanita Handicap , their next scheduled race . With Avalance the faster horse , and Gallant Lad a 20 to 1 underdog , the brains behind the gambling syndicate hope to cash in big when their ringer winds up in the winner's circle . Adding to the intrigue , the race timekeeper who's part of the syndicate has a back up plan to insure Gallant Lad's victory . He rigs one of the timing devices at the three quarter mile mark with a dart which will be used on any lead horse ahead of Gallant Lad . The dart does in fact disrupt Avalanche's timing , but he goes on to win the race anyway . With the syndicate foiled , the only thing left to do is for Chan to expose the mastermind . This he does with his usual cool demeanor , even though it means exposing Major Kent's son in law - " Truth sometimes like stab of cruel knife . " Currently , " Charlie Chan at the Racetrack " appears to be the most highly regarded Chan film on the IMDb website . Allowing for personal preferences , I found it to be one of the better Chan entries , although I feel Warner Oland's adventures in London and Shanghai are more intriguing , along with Sidney Toler's portrayal in " Murder Cruise " . As for Number # 1 Son Lee , he breathlessly bursts onto the final scene with news for Charlie ( after the case has been solved ) - " Hey Pop , I have another clue ! " Charlie wisely advises : " Save for next case , please . "

577143	1399158	56675	6.0	WAR HUNT ( Denis Sanders , 1962 )	John Saxon has a memorable role as a black-faced , gun-crazy soldier who volunteers for solitary nightly ambushes on the enemy until he finally cracks up completely and wants to be left behind in Korea . The film also marked the screen debuts of Robert Redford ( as the clean-cut rookie hero who stands up to Saxon’s fearsome grip on his unit ) , Sydney Pollack ( a rare early acting stint for him as a sympathetic sergeant ) and Tom Skerritt ( as a cheerful sergeant ) ; of course , the latter would later appear in the ultimate Korean War movie , Robert Altman’s M . A . S . H . ( 1970 ) . Other cast members include Tommy Matsuda ( as an orphaned Korean boy taken under Saxon’s wing and unwisely befriended by Redford ) , Charles Aidman ( as the Captain who often covers for Saxon’s insubordination given the importance of the information he gathers from his nightly rounds ) and Gavin MacLeod ( who advises Redford to steer clear of the highly-strung Saxon ) . Being set during the final days of the Korean War , the film features the deceptive and ironic musical interludes played on loudspeakers by the teasing enemy prior to the inevitable combat ; despite its obviously modest budget and low-key nature , it is effectively shot in gritty , black-and-white by veteran cinematographer Ted McCord and nicely scored by Bud Shank . On the other hand , co-producer Terry Sanders was an award-winning documentarian who seemingly brought to the film an unusually sensitive and anti-militaristic outlook , while his brother Denis was an occasional feature film director – including the sci-fi / exploitation flick INVASION OF THE BEE GIRLS ( 1973 ) – who had previously co-written the screenplay for Raoul Walsh’s WWII epic THE NAKED AND THE DEAD ( 1958 ) . Trivia note : reportedly , Francis Ford Coppola appears uncredited as a truck driver ; also , the film’s associate producer ( Noel Black ) later became an erratic director himself – most notably of PRETTY POISON ( 1968 ) .
469507	1532177	87995	3.0	Weird Film That Only Appeals To The Pretentious	I fail to see the appeal of REPO MAN . I concede that it contains a good opening hook where a policeman stops a car , opens the trunk and gets a nasty surprise . But after that the movie , like , the characters , just drives around aimlessly . It resembles a lot of movies of the period in that the musical soundtrack is more important than the thin narrative , but what makes it even worse is the painfully episodic quality of the storytelling . Just look at the number of scenes that feel they've been edited in the wrong order . I know that the sub genre known as " road movies " aren't famous for their tightly plotted structure . On top of that can anyone really explain the plot ? There's a difference between a cerebal film where the audience have to join up the dots but that's entirely different from one where the plot is absent . Director / screenwriter Alex Cox did later redeem himself with the biopic SID AND NANCY but seemed to disappear from the radar afterwards . The reason he's best remembered as being the presenter of the BBC's MOVIEDROME is that his films fail to appeal to a mainstream audience and REPO MAN greatly reflects this
393460	2483625	25316	10.0	The Hero As Comedian	In his autobiography , The Name's Above the Title , Frank Capra said that until It Happened One Night drama had four stock characters , the hero , the heroine , the comedian , and the villain . What Capra did and you might notice he followed that in a whole lot of his films , the characters of hero and comedian are combined . Not completely though because Claudette Colbert gets a few laughs herself , especially with that system all her own . But in doing what he did for Clark Gable's character , Capra created a whole new type of screen comedy , the classic screwball comedy and It Happened One Night surely set the mold . Capra's autobiography told the story of the making of It Happened One Night which in itself could be a movie . Capra worked for Columbia Pictures which at that time was a minor studio , along the lines of Republic or Monogram . As Capra tells it he had a vision about this story that Samuel Hopkins Adams wrote and persuaded Harry Cohn to buy it . Capra also had a stroke of good luck . Adolph Zukor at Paramount and Louis B . Mayer at MGM were looking to punish a couple of recalcitrant stars , Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable . The idea was to show these two what it was like to work in a small budget studio without all the perks of Paramount and MGM . In fact the description of Gable arriving to work at Columbia that first day , drunk as a skunk , is priceless . Capra dressed him down good and said that to his credit Gable came to work afterwards and couldn't have been more cooperative . At some point Harry Cohn at Columbia was convinced that maybe Capra had something . He had in fact delivered for Columbia the previous year with Lady for a Day . So the publicity drums were beat . The rest as they say is history . It Happened One Night won the first Oscar grand slam , Best Picture , Best Director , Best Actor , and Best Actress . It won the first Oscars Columbia Pictures ever got and lifted it right into the ranks of the major studios . And it set the standard for screwball comedy . The film could never have gotten off the ground were it not for the chemistry of Gable and Colbert . They're together for most of the film so if it doesn't click between the two of them , you have people walking out in droves . Colbert had already played a wide variety of parts at Paramount , ranging from Poppaea and Cleopatra to comedies with Maurice Chevalier like The Big Pond . Gable had played a whole lot of tough guys on both sides of the law at MGM . It Happened One Night showed he had some real comic talent , a flair MGM exploited in his roles from then on in . Gable and Colbert did only one other film together , Boom Town for MGM . You can't get much more different than those two films . Boom Town had a huge MGM budget , Spencer Tracy and Hedy Lamarr as well , and a lot of special effects involving the oil industry and hazards therein . It's also a great film , but it's not a classic like It Happened One Night .
405935	2020269	91778	3.0	The Other Side is just as dull . . .	Personally , I hated " Poltergeist " with a passion , but I can't really blame producers for wanting to further exploit a profitable franchise , especially not when I can watch these sequels for free on the television . The original " Poltergeist " , directed by Tobe Hooper but clearly a Spielberg-pastiche , is one of the most overrated and boring movies of all time and the sequels ( this one as well as part 3 , starring Tom Skerritt ) are every bit as lame . At least this film didn't exaggeratedly use Steven Spielberg's name during the promotion campaigns but it IS very docile and obedient to his ideas . This means that part two once again is childish and very UN-spooky horror , filled with visual effects that lack the force of conviction and featuring characters you can't possibly symphatize with . The Freeling family , with their supernatural medium for a daughter , moves into Gramma Jess ' house after the events that made their own house vanish into thin air . Pretty soon a bony old man ( Julian Beck , who's about the only slightly uncanny appearance in the entire film ) comes around to take Carol Anne back to the spiritual dimension . . . Why ? I missed that part . The Freelings do get more assistance this time , from a big Indian fella ( Will Sampson from " One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest " who I like more when he plays a silent character ) and , hooray hooray ! , the ultra-annoying Zelda Rubinstein , whose squeaky voice makes you want to pulverize her whenever she opens her mouth . The extremely boring screenplay and the total lack of humor in order to put thing into perspective a little make this a truly pointless film , only for die-hard fans of the first . The stupid , fairy-tale like ending nearly made me feel miserable . . . especially since you could see it coming from miles away .

Ride the rapids , go over a waterfall , suffer the slings and arrows of the German fort at Shona , get half eaten by clouds of flying gnats , be leeched by slimy critters as you haul the boat by hand through mephitic swamps , half die from fever , come within an inch of being hanged by Theodore Bikel and Peter ( " I think I shall hang you twice " ) Bull aboard the German riverboat - - and have more fun doing it than you could have imagined . It's not all action . There is a tentative and touching romance developed between Humphrey Bogart as the skipper of the decrepit launch and Katherine Hepburn as the skinny , psalm-singing old maid who convinces him that the Louisa , the German gunboat , must be sunk with improvised torpedoes . Hepburn is a tough babe in this movie , tougher than Bogart . She stoically endures the death of her missionary brother , Robert Morley , at the hands of the marauding Germans when the First World War begins . Instead of being frightened by the rapids , she's thrilled by them . And she pushes the common-sensical Bogart to heights of inspiration , strength , and heroism . Bogart gives the role everything he's got - - and that's a lot . He cultivates not another variation on his familiar screen persona but a genuine portrait of a character that already seems familiar to us but which we've never associated with Bogart before . He's always been a dapper urbanite , but here we see him chuckling gleefully as he kicks the temperamental engine on his boat . Drunk , he brings up his " poor old mother " and is about to weep . One of his best scenes has him at tea with Morley and Hepburn , uncomfortable with all that politesse and distracted by his gastric motility . Morley reads the newspaper and announces that a rival of his has just been promoted to Bishop . Bogart jumps in his chair , startled , and says , " Huh " ? Then his belly begins to groan audibly - - very audibly . " Have some more tea , Mister Allnut , " says Hepburn , doing her best to ignore the rumbles . It's much funnier than Eddy Murphy's family all ventilating their bowels at the dinner table in " The Nutty Professor . " See it at once or be hanged twice .
493575	342623	368658	9.0	The ultimate in " Who am I ? "	Billy Crudup is a " Stage Beauty " in the 2004 film costarring Claire Danes , Rupert Everett , Tom Wilkinson , Ben Chaplin , Zoe Tapper and Richard Griffiths . Based on the writings of Samuel Pepys about a stage actor named Ned Kynaston ( Crudup ) , the plot centers around the repeal of an English law forbidding women on the stage during the time of King Charles II , 1660 . The shining star in the female roles is Ned Kynaston who essays Ophelia , Desdemona , Juliet et al . to the enthusiastic approval of audiences and in particular , an audience of one , his lover , The Duke of Buckingham ( Chaplin ) . Because he is in such great demand , Kynaston's boss Betterton ( Wilkinson ) has given him cast approval . With Kynaston's head getting too big for his wigs , he insults Sir Charles Sedley , who tries to pick him up thinking he's a woman ( but not at all put off when he learns he's a man ) , and Sedley conspires to get revenge . Then Kynaston insults Nell Gwynn ( Tapper ) , the King's mistress , by not approving of women performing on stage . Before you can say " Desdemona , " the law has been repealed . His dresser Maria ( Claire Danes ) adores and admires Ned , aspires to be an actress , and has performed Desdemona in an illegal Othello done in a tavern . Sir Charles manages to bring her to the attention of the theater while taking Kynaston out of commission by beating the pulp out of him ( with the help of two fans whom Kynaston also insulted ) . When Ned recovers enough to attempt to get his job back , he finds he's no longer in demand , his dresser is a star , his lover is getting married and , having fantasized that Ned was a woman while they made love , no longer wants him . But he has one friend left - a most unlikely supporter . This is a wonderful , richly produced film marvelously written by Jeffrey Hatcher and directed by Richard Eyre that tells of the journey each of us has to our true identity - not just who we are as people but our gender identity as well . Without female costumes , wigs , and mannerisms , Ned doesn't know who or what he is . In love with Ned and hating him at the same time , Maria doesn't know if she's a good actress or not ( she isn't ) . When she asks Mr . Pepys if she was good on opening night , he tells her the truth , " There was no comparison , " as she's the first woman to act on stage . " She did what she did first ; you did what you did last , " Betterton tells Kynaston . Working together , they find their true souls - not just in each other , but in themselves . The Bible says " male and female He created them . " Thinking about this line in the context of " Stage Beauty , " I like to think that we each possess male and female qualities . Ned searches not only for his maleness but just as importantly , how to express himself artistically as a male . Impersonating a female was to him a very high art - he feels there is no way to be creative now . He also has to learn about his sexuality - I suppose some people will feel that Ned has been " made straight . " Not at all . He has instead become a whole person , and that whole person is better able to encompass his entire sexuality . The brilliant , exciting end of the film is much like the creative process but instead of flowering as it is nurtured , it explodes in a thrilling collaboration . The performances right down the line are fantastic . Billy Crudup is not only a total Adonis but an amazing actor with a perfect British accent and handle on the dialogue to match his perfect face - he is equally convincing as the confused Ned , the mannered Desdemona and the brutal Othello . As Maria , Claire Danes is a match for him - subservient dresser , serious actress , star , friend and lover , and with a British accent that , like Crudup's , is so totally organic , one could easily believe she is British . The rest of the cast is breathtaking , making each role a gem . I can't even single any one actor out ; each not only created a wonderful character , but were not in any way slighted by the writer . Some of the dialogue in this film is as hilarious as other dialogue in it is poignant . I'd love to know where this film was during Oscar time . Apparently it did not have the huge studio behind it that " Shakespeare in Love " enjoyed , which is a pity , because it deserved to be singled out for many of the top awards - acting in every category , directing , writing , and costumes . I see it won " Overlooked Film of the Year " somewhere . This is a jewel that definitely fell out of the Oscar crown .
366102	3109237	93872	1.0	" You're all useless and crazy . "	Robot Holocaust is about the lamest , most pathetic attempt at making a post-apocalyptic movie that I've seen . And I thought the Italians were the masters of wretched Mad Max wannabes . Some of those movies like Escape 2000 are positively brilliant in comparison with this piece of poo . The plot is nonsensical ? even with a narrator setting up every scene . And boy does it drag . Scene after scene with nothing of any interest happening . The special effects ( and I use the word " special " loosely ) consist of sock puppets . Yes , that's right ? sock puppets ! The acting is abysmal . Angelika Jager is in the running for worst performance I've ever seen . Sure , she's French or German or whatever ? but man is she bad . I cannot think of a single positive thing to say about the movie . So I'll stop there because ten sentences on this junk is about ten too many . However , and fortunately for me , I saw the MST3K version of Robot Holocaust . Some of the things that made the movie so bad helped make this MST3K episode a winner . For a season one episode , the riffs come fast and furious and hit their mark just about every time . On my MST3K rating scale , I give this episode a ? seek it out .
505578	2911571	113429	7.0	strange and sterile	Visually this is a rather strange mix of David Lynch , Guy Maddin , and who knows what all else . Story-wise , it's a tale of a man who goes to a school ( Instituta Benjamina ) to learn how to be a servant because he's not expecting much out of life . And beyond that , you've got me . The school is run by a brother and sister and there's only one lesson taught , over and over . The institute itself is full of strange things , all presented in a rather creepy way , and these strange things include secret rooms and passages and even an opportunity to sniff powdered deer ejaculate , wow . And for some reason deer parts play some kind of role in this , but who knows what . It seems the sister is rather lonely and so is her brother and they both have their sights set on young Jakob , who just enrolled . But really , beyond that , nothing is particularly clear . Visually it's quite interesting but it's not particularly moving and is just sort of " there " . Definitely an art film , but not one that would probably have wide appeal . .

Sexy heroic detective Gina O'Bannon ( Tamara Davies ) teams up with handsome Ted Gage ( Daniel Cosgrove ) , who lost his brother in a suspicious " accident " , to probe the case , but it takes shuffling through the assorted red herrings before finding out who is responsible . What made this rise a little above the norm for me was a good cast , even if it does make waste of some of the performers . ( Tim Thomerson and Grace Zabriskie have disappointingly minor roles , and guest stars Mickey Rourke and Tone Loc have one scene cameos . ) Davies and Cosgrove are decent leads , with Dennis Boutsikaris , Ken Lerner , Scott Rinker , and Brandon Karrer doing fine in support . The special effects are a major drawback . These CGI roaches are not convincing in the slightest , and I honestly felt a little cheated that the filmmakers ' low budget couldn't allow us some nasty looking corpses . There's a rather drab look to the movie , with not a lot in the way of color . This does work for some movies , and it does create a dreary feeling to these proceedings . Neal Acrees ' music is appropriately somber . Ultimately , this movie just doesn't have a whole lot to offer . It's the kind of thing that genre fans have seen before , and will see again . As a standard B bug movie , I found it watchable enough , but no more so . It recycles scenes from other movies - " Last Action Hero " , " Rush Hour " , " Chain Reaction " - as a prime indicator of a pretty low budget . It plods along and just doesn't deliver that well even on a visceral level , what with such bad special effects . The final roach manifestation is good for an amusing gimmick , but the ending is just lame . I won't say that roaches never had it so bad but they've been better utilized before .
518739	8239592	462200	8.0	Samuel Jackson and Christina Ricci are both outstanding in this strong and poignant tale of sin and redemption	Reclusive and angry former blues singer turned farmer Lazarus ( superbly played by the always excellent Samuel L . Jackson ) is in a hurting way after his wife Rose leaves him after twelve years of unhappy marriage . Brassy and tormented trampy white trash nymphomaniac Rae ( a remarkably raw and startling performance by Christina Ricci ) sure ain't feeling too good , either . Lazrus finds Rae's battered body on the side of the road . After nursing her back to health , Lazarus chains Rae to his radiator in order to help the troubled lass overcome her demons . Writer / director Craig Brewer uses the potentially lurid and tasteless premise to spin a surprisingly potent and poignant tale of sin , redemption and the intrinsic fallibility of human nature . Rae and Lazarus are two lost and broken souls who help each other heal and become whole again . Jackson and Ricci are terrific in the leads , with equally strong support from Justin Timberlake as Rae's loyal , long-suffering boyfriend Ronnie , S . Epatha Merkerson as Lazarus ' helpful lady friend Angela , John Cothran Jr . as the compassionate Reverend R . L . , and onetime 70's child actress Kim Richards as Rae's bitter estranged mother Sandy . The vividly brooding and flavorsome Southern Gothic atmosphere , Amy Vincent's polished cinematography , Scott Bomar's moody score and the first-rate soulful blues soundtrack are all likewise on the money as well . As an added treat , Jackson growls out a few fantastic get-down gritty blues numbers and Ricci even sings a touchingly sweet rendition of the gospel tune " This Little Light of Mine . " Offbeat , inspired and original , " Black Snake Moan " overall qualifies as an extremely moving , compelling and provocative winner .

Jeannie Crain ( Peggy ) " Pinky " ' 49 and William Holden ( Jason ) " Sabrina " ' 54 showed how a young couple with just love in their hearts for each other can overcome all materialistic problems in life and still strive to obtain a college degree . However , they needed the help of Edmund Gweenn , ( Professor Henry Barnes ) " Miracle on 34th St . " ' 47 ( Santa Claus ) and Gene Lockhart ( Prof . Edward Bell ) , father of Gene Lockhart , who gave excellent supporting roles . If you get a chance to view this film on TV , it is a film to view and enjoy even in the 21 Century , where young people have the same struggles to pay the high costs of getting a simple college education even in the late 1940's .
462135	2467618	2303	4.0	A whole lotta action , . . . but I'm not sure WHY	This is a short film by D . W . Griffith for Biograph Studios and is full of some pretty exciting action . Blanche Sweet is an apparently nice girl that was kidnapped and secreted aboard a boat . The only problem is , WHY ? ! There's really no context and I had no idea why some crew members from a sailing ship kidnapped the woman in the first place and why later they tried to kill the captain and take the boat . Some explanatory inter-title cards or making the film longer than 13 minutes might have taken care of all this . With just a little more work , this could have been an excellent little film . And , given that it's a Griffith film , you KNOW that the woman will be rescued ( they always are in his films ) - - so there isn't all that much excitement or suspense . It's a time-passer and that's all .
496854	1355507	424890	3.0	" What about that guy named Guy ? " Rubbish low budget horror .	The Choke starts as a rock band known as The Choke prepare for a gig at a nightclub called ' Club 905 ' owned & run by Guy Johnson ( Andrew Parker ) . Lead singer Dylan ( Sean Cook ) & guitar player Mike ( Jason McKee ) plan to tell the other band members , bass player London ( Brooke Bailey ) & drummer Nancy ( Tom Olson ) , that they are both going solo & their services won't be needed any longer . Once at the club Dylan prepares but Mike doesn't show up & the gig turns into a disaster . Then just as the band think things couldn't get any worse they find a dead body in the cellar , that all the doors have been locked so they can't get out & that they can't trust anyone as a mysterious killer begins picking them off one-by-one . . . Produced & directed by Juan A . Mas The Choke is a standard by-the-numbers teen slasher that really doesn't have anything going for it . The script by Jessica Dolan & Susannah Lowber ( not too many horror films out there penned by ladies . . . ) has some surprisingly good character's in it & some nifty dialogue but while it's much better than a lot of modern shot on a camcorder type horror in that respect it's so slow & boring that even a few interesting character's can't come anywhere close to saving it . As one would expect all the usual teen slasher clichés are used , from the isolated location the victims can't escape from , the cast of good looking teenagers who keep splitting up , a few murders & a really poor twist ending that tries to mimic something like Scream ( 1996 ) & be surprising but doesn't make a whole lot of sense when you think about it logically ( they couldn't have done some of the things they were supposed to ) & to make matters even worse I guessed who the killer was fairly early on & even though I don't want to boast I was spot on . Then there's the fact that the makers of The Choke felt that it's audience would be entertained by showing endless ( well it feels endless while watching it ) scenes of teenagers walking around dark corridors doing nothing in particular , I am sorry but there is only so many scenes like this that I can take before it starts to become tedious . The kill count is low , at first they all decide to stick together ( good idea ) but then they all just randomly decide to split up & go their separate ways ( bad idea when there's a killer on the loose ) , the pace is lethargic , the kill scenes are unimaginative & to top it all off the twist ending is poor . Director Mas does alright , the film looks OK for the most part although there are the odd occasions where he uses some annoying post production editing technique like slow motion or frame skipping . The gore levels aren't really up to scratch , there's some blood splatter , a guy with a hole in his chest , a few dead bodies & someone impaled on some metal poles . Most of the kills happen off screen with the axe kill at the end a good example of the film not actually showing anything . Since the film is about a rock band there's quite a rock orientated soundtrack with some truly horrible , horrible rock songs used on it . I am sorry rock fans but to my ears this crap is just noise pollution . It's not scary , there's no real atmosphere & the lack of blood & gore is just inexcusable when the rest of the film is so bad . With a supposed budget of about $1 , 000 , 000 The Choke is well made with reasonable production values , it looks cheap to be sure but not as cheap as many low budget horror films look . Shot in a place called Spokane in Washington apparently . The acting is one of the films strongest points as it's generally pretty good all round , I mean no-one is going to win an Oscar but it ain't half bad . The Choke is a throughly routine Scream style teen slasher that has one of the weakest twist endings ever & a criminal lack of blood , gore , violence , nudity & dead bodies . I mean if a slasher hasn't got any sex or gore then what's the point ? Those are the only things that the average slasher is worth watching for , right ?

496933	1355507	120841	8.0	" Welcome to the maternity ward . . . from hell . " The sexiest alien in the universe is back . . .	Species II starts with the first manned mission to Mars code named ' Excursion ' manned by Patrick Ross ( justin Lazard ) , Dennis Gamble ( Mykelti Williamson ) & Anne Sampas ( Myriam Cyr ) reaching it's destination after 11 months in space . Patrick Ross becomes the first person to walk on Mars , he takes various soil samples & heads back to the Excursion . When back on board some strange slime starts to pour out of the sample cannister . . . Back on Earth the astronauts are treated like hero's but while at a fund raising event Patrick has sex with two débutant's ( Nancy La Scala & Raquel Gardener ) whose stomachs open up & human like baby alien creatures emerge . Patrick asks his Father Senator Judson Ross ( James Cromwell ) for help but is ignored as Judson doesn't want any bad publicity , Patrick continues to create alien offspring using various prostitutes , pole dancers & horny housewives . Meanwhile Dr . Orinsky ( Baxter Harris ) is attacked & killed by Patrick's mutant alien blood & General Carter Burgees ( George Dzundza ) calls in professional hit man Preston Lennox ( Michael Madsen , returning from the original ) & Dr . Laura Baker ( Marg Helgenberger , also an original cast member ) who has created Eve ( Natasha Henstridge , yet another returnee ) from a frozen alien embryo ( mentioned in the original ) who seems to have a telepathic link with Patrick , but to use Eve's vital ability to it's maximum potential they must turn her almost completely alien . . . Directed by Peter Medak I have to admit I get a real kick out of Species II & I like it more than the original Species ( 1995 ) , I just love the thing & for that I apologise to no one . The script by Chris Brancato moves along at a nice pace & is never dull or boring which is always a good start & it features more blood , gore , sex & nudity than just about any other major studio film I can think of . This is pure exploitation for the modern generation ! Species II knows that it's all about blood & nudity & doesn't shy away from it , in fact it revels in it ! The actual plot is about as silly as you could imagine , it doesn't make a whole lot of sense & is somewhat clichéd & suffers from simplistic one liner type dialogue but what the hell , I just like to sit back & enjoy the bombardment of nastiness that Species II takes great pleasure in serving up . The characters are a bit dumb especially the comic relief black guy & the fat General with one eye but hey , it's all good fun . There are some great gore scenes in Species II , exploding stomachs , a cool effect when Patrick blows his head off with a shotgun & it grows back , slimy alien tentacles , a nasty looking cut up blood splattered corpse on an autopsy table , someone has their guts pulled out & lots of blood splattered all over the shop . Species II doesn't skimp on the sex & nudity either as it's all here , a threesome , straight sex , alien sex , a motel complex full of prostitutes , a strip club & rape . Trivia : there is even a deleted scene on the DVD in which Patrick picks up a woman who turns out to be a transsexual so after finding out he breaks her neck . Technically Species II is pretty good , director Medak uses some cool shots like zooming into people's eyes & nice angles like the Star Wars ( 1979 ) rip off start as the spaceship zooms across the screen only this time Medak places his camera above it instead of underneath . The special effects are actually very impressive & hold up well even now & don't forget Species II is over 7 years old & that's a long time in effects development . The CGI is solid & doesn't embarrass itself while Steve Johnson & his team pile on the slime & blood in some great yucky over-the-top scenes . The aliens designed by H . R . Giger look organic & visually cool especially Eve although this is where some of the effects become a little bit ropey . I liked the production design with the contrasting hi-tech labs & the old dark run down outhouse building at the end complete with pulsating purple alien cocoons ! The acting is not going to win anyone any awards but Madsen as the cool hit man Lennox is likable as usual , strangely the gorgeous Henstridge isn't in the film that much & only gets topless at the end but it's worth the wait boys . . . Species II is terrific entertainment as far as I'm concerned , I just loved all the nudity sex & gore , I was in heaven ! Species II has a bad reputation which is fair enough , but to be honest I don't give a sit if anyone else likes it because I did & that's all that matters to me . Great entertainment for those with the stomach but anyone with delicate moral sensibilities should stay away . . .

429142	1173088	120836	6.0	If " There's Something About Mary " was the best of the sitcom comedies , " Lost & Found " is at the bottom of the barrel .	There seems to be some confusion about what is funny nowadays . Let me give filmmakers a clue . Funny Men Who Will Always Be Funny : Steve Martin , Bill Murray , John Candy , Bob Hope , Jack Lemmon , Walter Matthau , et al . People Who Are Not and Never Will Be Funny : David Spade . Now that we have that out of the way , let's get on , shall we ? " Lost & Found " is a marginally funny movie that only has a few funny gags . It is more of a sitcom stretched out to full length than a full-length motion picture . There are conveniently close-living love interests . Poor characters live in luxurious apartments . The main characters all exchange lines we would expect their writers give them to say , and nothing realistic . This is beginning to sound like " Friends the Movie " . . . And there is a certain problem with enlisting David Spade as a romantic lead . 1 . He's a snotty little swine who , I think , many women would hate and not adore . 2 . He's annoying , and his humor is contradictory , making everything he says a contradiction . Which means when he wants to express his love to a woman , " I hate you " is the best choice . But let's be honest , can you imagine David Spade as a woman charmer ? Me , neither . Let's just say love , subtlety and truth are not his expertise . In my opinion , David Spade is not a funny guy . New ( er ) comedians like Adam Sandler at least have the visible urge to be funny , a sense of liveliness and joy . David Spade has neither . He just stands there , cracks badly-written lines in bad monotone , and expects us to laugh ; what's it all about , David ? " Lost & Found " is about an Italian restaurant owner named Dylan ( Spade ) , who is not Italian , but expects his patrons to ignore this . Dylan maintains a failing restaurant downtown , where he walks about and cracks jokes to the guests in his restaurant and scares little children . Dylan has a big future somewhere . Unfortunately , it doesn't seem to be on this planet . One day , after losing his clothes in a game of strip poker with a gang of old women , Dylan sees a beautiful woman ( Sophie Marceau ) living a few apartments down from him , playing an instrument and sitting by a window at night so naked men like Dylan can stand right outside , stare at her , and not be seen . We know there's going to be a joke about people walking outside their rooms and seeing Dylan , and - oh , here it is . Big surprise : It's handled badly , it's not funny , and the people who spotted Dylan have no urge to call the police . Why ? Easy : They're written characters just there for a cheap gag . No characters seem to make up their own choices . There's a bad case of Scripteritis and Writtenmonia in this film . In hopes of getting closer to the beautiful woman , Dylan decides to kidnap her small dog . He then shows up at her house and helps her search for the vicious animal . This goes on for a while , giving Dylan a chance to grow closer to Marceau . I do not know why Marceau's character would ever feel anything for Dylan , who parades around like a little brat throwing insults at her old boyfriend like , " I'm a local yokel " ( har-har ) . " Lost & Found " seems to want to be another " There's Something About Mary , " but it's lacking everything , right down to its obvious rip-off of the dog ( which bears a startling resemblance to the canine in " Mary " ) . " Mary " might have been a conveniently written comedy , but we cared enough for the characters and laughed enough at the jokes that we didn't care . There are no strong laughs in " Lost & Found , " and we don't care for the characters . And as we await the occasional chuckle , the convenience of the script becomes more and more apparent , as do the major flaws the film has . If " There's Something About Mary " was the best of the sitcom comedies , " Lost & Found " is at the bottom of the barrel . And for further notice , here are other comedians who are not funny : Chris Farley , Chris Rock , Norm Macdonald , Colin Quinn , Rob Schneider , Jimmy Fallon . stars - John Ulmer
559490	2626332	268978	1.0	Total Garbage !	This is another hit for Bettany , and another dialed-in crapfest from Crowe . I do NOT GET the adulation awarded this film by critics . The screenwriters have completely bastardized a better story . Just for the sake of correctness , Nash didn't invent game theory as this work attempts to claim . He came up with a notion of equilibrium , which is simply brilliant and he more than deserves the Nobel . But Crowe does NOT . This was supposed to be a historical film , but due to Crowe's lackluster performance , backed up by his aggressive contractual negotiations , his character has been given credit for things he did not do ! In a learned person's opinion , this is an irresponsible , and disgraceful film mainly due to Crowe's contractual screen time , which necessitated giving his character credit for things he should not have been portrayed as having done , and his totally crappy , dialed in performance . This was a typical Hollywood whitewash of the truth , and a typical Hollywood performance by Crowe . When will they just STOP handing this untalented hack roles like this ? ! It rates a from . . . the Fiend : .

Hmm , I tried to find it in my movie book but nothing seemed to match up with this . Anyway , in the tradition of great marketing ploys , this is touted on the box as being Monty Python directed by Fellini on acid . OK , there are some Python-esque moments but only in look , not in feel . I wouldn't doubt though that there was some acid involved in the making of this . It's OK , it's not bad , really , but it doesn't quite go far enough with some of the bizarre antics to be truly satisfying . It has its moments , and some scenes are pretty odd , but nothing really awe-inspiring . Visitors to a large asylum find that the tables have been turned on the doctor and his staff , and they're all imprisoned and the loonies are in charge . Visually interesting but as I mentioned , nothing to make you gape .
403223	453228	417217	6.0	Not bad but sad	Well , a OK movie . I did notice some old USFL footage from the 80's the NFL would not want to be tied with this film I guess . I recognized a few old USFL teams if one looks closer at the film . The Boston / New Orleans Breakers , Mephis Show Boats , L A Express ( I believe the quarter back was Steve Young ) , and The New Jersey Generals ( I believe the quarter was Doug Flutie ) . A couple of teams I could not recognized . Back to the movie , directing at a good pace , and well acted . The gambler Pacino is a sad and unlikable character . The movie is a down beat film with the message of gambler appetite for destruction and pushing life too hard . It is never winning 20 its losing 200 . The end is about life choice and one is what the protagonist does .
432489	2171244	132563	6.0	Hot Naked Women ! Action in the bush ! Splendor in the grass !	Maybe if they used different tag lines to advertise this movie , it would have greater appeal . While all of the above is true , it was a small part of a wonderful film about George Adamson ( Richard Harris ) and Tony Fitzjohn ( John Michie ) . Those familiar with Born Free know about Adamson . This film is about his life in Kenya after wards , and the relationship with Fitzjohn , who went on to do the same work in Tanzania . It has a documentary feel throughout and absolutely stunning cinematography as they interact with the lions in the bush . It is sometimes bloody as the natives revolt , and the battle between men and animals will get your blood boiling , especially when Terrence ( Ian Bannen ) discovers his precious elephants destroyed by ivory poachers . A film for all animal lovers , and an outstanding performance by Harris .
366561	3109237	113135	1.0	" I have a job too ; I'm a tool . "	I've just about reached my limit . I've watched more than my share of bad movies in the past few months . Sure , as is the case with Future War , I've watched many of these movies courtesy of and with the assistance of Mystery Science Theater 3000 - but I've watched them just the same . Future War may be the last for a while . It's so bad I'm ready to swear off bad movies all together . The plot is a completely ridiculous mish-mash of incomprehensible ideas that never made a lick of sense to me . Something about a traveler from the future with cyborgs and their dinosaur " trackers " hot on his heels . The only person he's got to turn to for help is a former druggy / prostitute turned nun facing a crisis of faith . Like I said , none of it makes sense . I've said this so many times that I'm starting to sound like a broken record , but Future War is bad in every way a movie can be bad . The acting is beyond pitiful . Neither of the movies ' two leads , Daniel Bernhardt or Travis Brooke Stewart , seem capable of acting their way onto a community theater stage , let alone a sound-stage . Most surprising to me is that Bernhardt went on to have a fairly successful career , because in Future War , he comes across as nothing more than a Jean-Claude Van Damme wannabe without any of Van Damme's talent . ( Did I just insinuate that Van Damme has talent ? ) Beyond the acting , the special effects are of particular note . The dinosaurs are about the most Gawd awful things I've seen in a movie . I could film something about as realistic with the plastic dinosaurs my son has in his room . Wait a minute - I think that might be what they used ! Finally ( and believe me , I could go on forever ) , the editing in Future War is atrocious . Some scenes are edited so poorly that it's all but impossible to follow the action . Overall , Future War is about as bad as a movie can get . I can't really come up with an inspired description , so I'll end this by saying , " It sux ! "
504628	2911571	197857	7.0	( School ) Girls in Chains , now on DVD from Code Red	Frank & John live in a great big house in the middle of nowhere with their domineering mother , and they bring home girls to keep in the basement , mainly for John , who is a bit simple-minded ( to say the least ) to play with . Of course , John likes to play games with the girls , but he likes to play doctor , and they like to play hide and seek , except most of them don't get to hide for long . And sometimes they try to get away , but they don't make it . John likes to operate , too , apparently , but that's only hinted at , we don't get to see it . Frank ( as played by Gary Kent , of Al Adamson films , etc ) is the quiet one . That doesn't mean he's sane , though . When having a nice chat with one of the chained-up girls , we find that he was once engaged but that his bride-to-be was a bit put off when she found out that he still wet the bed and had sex with his mother . Our dynamic duo make one mistake though in one of their choices of girls to kidnap , because her boyfriend comes looking for her & proves to be their undoing . In some ways this is reminiscent of Psycho , Texas Chainsaw Massacre , and Mother's Day , and even a dash of The Sinful Dwarf , but except for " Psycho " , this one predates all the others . A nasty exploitation film and if you don't think it's quite nasty enough , it WAS made in 1973 so it was very nasty for its time . .
418710	1609079	25119	4.0	Vienna sausage at its wurst .	This movie's title is almost entirely irrelevant . Ricardo Cortez portrays a suave musician in Vienna ( memo to a previous IMDb reviewer : Vienna is not in Germany ) , who lures young maidens to his bachelor flat by offering to play Stravinsky's ' Firebird ' . Of course , he's a cad with dozens of notches on his bedpost . Sooner or later , somebody is going to kill this guy . Sure enough , somebody does . This is one of those murder mysteries that features a subjective camera shot from the viewpoint of the murderer , so that the victim looks the murderer right in the eyes but we don't know the murderer's identity . We see Cortez welcoming someone into his digs , and a woman's arm enters the frame . . . so we know the killer is a woman . And she's white , too . Other than that , her identity is a mystery . C . Aubrey Smith , more phlegmatic than usual , is the world-weary police inspector who's got to wade through the suspects . The prime suspect is Cortez's neighbour abovestairs , Verree Teasdale , whose lovely young daughter Anita Louise may have been ruined by Cortez . In this movie , Teasdale is married to Lionell Atwill , so she's got enough problems . I'll give this movie some credit . The solution to whodunnit was a genuine surprise to me . Likewise , her motive ( yes , the killer IS a woman ) was something I didn't expect . Unfortunately , her motive isn't very plausible either . Also , this movie starts out as a whodunnit , but C . Aubrey Smith's sleuth spends much less time trying to solve the murder than he spends pontificating on the morals of the younger generation and such . This movie is based on a play , and it shows : there's lots of talk and very little action . This movie was directed by William Dieterle , a brilliant craftsman who believed in astrology and numerology , and whose artistic decisions were often dictated by the horoscopes cast for him by his wife . She must have put her azimuth in the wrong house this time , because Dieterle's talents - - so amply demonstrated in many other films - - aren't much in evidence here . Several good actors try hard with weak material . I'll rate this movie just .

382011	449021	26029	6.0	Thought provoking mystery . A Hitchcock classic .	The classic mistaken man caught up in the middle of high drama and intrigue . A man ( Robert Donat ) comes to the aid of a young woman ( Madeleine Carroll ) only to get involved in a cloak and dagger chase through London and Scotland . The mysterious spy activities culminates in a novel climax . Donat and Carroll are flawless . Their banter will influence movie dialog for decades to come . This mystery is not that easily unwound . A perfect example of the genius of Hitchcock's pre-war British period . Also in the movie are Godfrey Tearle and Frank Cellier . A small , but major role in the plot is played by Wylie Watson as Mr . Memory .
396792	2483625	106079	10.0	Will We Get More ?	Taking a lot from his previous cop drama Hill Street Blues , Steven Bochco fashioned in NYPD Blue one of the biggest television hits ever . It was the kind of show that even in its last days still wanted its fans begging for more . And we may yet get more , who knows . Two characters remained through the show's run and anchored it until it's conclusion . Dennis Franz as Detective Andy Sipowicz , a very flawed individual , an alcoholic bigot , but the best detective around . And Gordon Clapp as Detective Greg Medavoy , a decent man with a lot of issues of confidence . The rest of the cast came and went through the 15th precinct of Manhattan just like life itself . Sipowicz took over the show after the departure of his first partner David Caruso . He was predicted to be a breakout star and he sought to take advantage of his new found fame with a major movie career . A lot of folks wondered if NYPD Blue would survive at that point . Sipowicz was supposed to be a supporting character with the problems just mentioned , Archie Bunker with a badge . But he went in Alcoholics Anonymous and preached its virtues as did Daniel J . Travanti from Hill Street Blues . And over a dozen years , Sipowicz grew in strength and character . Dennis Franz had three succeeding partners all who had a different character and background . Jimmy Smits , Rick Schroeder , and Mark-Paul Gosselaar were all very good and very different . In the case of Gosselaar he was finally able to shake the casting specter of Zack Morris from Saved By The Bell . The women detectives all had an individuality about them as well . Probably Kim Delaney as the alcoholic Diane Russell was the best . She was counseled by Andy Sipowicz and brought into AA , but she also wound up marrying Jimmy Smits's character Bobby DeSimone and bravely carrying on after his demise . Sipowicz married ADA Sylvia Costas played by Sharon Lawrence and after she was killed in an unforgettable court house shooting episode . Andy later married again to young detective Charlotte Ross and found again some domestic happiness . In fact it was getting to be a running joke towards the end that it was as fatal to be around Dennis Franz as it was to be involved with a Cartright from Bonanza . Partners Jimmy Smits and Rick Schroeder died , wife Sylvia Lawrence died , and his son from an even earlier marriage was killed all during the run of the show . But Sipowicz dealt with it all . The detective squad of the 15th precinct had four heads , James McDaniel , Esai Morales , John O'Donahue , and Graham Currie . One of them actually was a cop , John O'Donahue . He played this mediocre time server Eddie Gibson who was an absolute doofus and originally was a detective on the graveyard shift . When he took the sergeant's test , passed it and wound up succeeding Morales the whole squad was ready to flip . But Gibson wasn't totally stupid , he knew these people and he basically let them have their head . James McDaniel had a wonderful character in Arthur Fancy and he had all the problems and frustrations of being a black man who rises in the NYPD . I remember once in an episode he was asked why he didn't get rid of a bigot like Sipowicz . To which he replied if I got rid of him it isn't like I'm going to get as his replacement some candidate for the brotherhood award . Probably I'll get another white cop with the same attitudes , but who isn't half as good on the job . We got to know all these people and what baggage they might have brought to each case they were assigned to . Probably NYPD Blue could have kept going , but Steven Bochco decided to end it while still on high . And he did in fact give it an ending of sorts unlike Hill Street Blues . It was an ironic ending in fact for Sipowicz . But you'll have to see the final episode in fact you'll have to see the entire series which you can catch on cable television to appreciate why . But the elements are there for a TV movie or six . I've got a good feeling that people would want to see them . We may not have seen the last of the detective squad of the 15th precinct from NYPD Blue .
582309	1219578	40338	8.0	Through a child ' s eye , darkly . . . .	When you are a child , you often hope you will live absorbing adventures and that the fairy tale you are reading will come true . When you are , like the hero of Carol Reed's movie , an only child , cause your father is a VIP , you have a tendency to build your own world and to invent your own heroes who might have killed some day , but in self-defense only , and in a faraway country . Mrs Baines is the witch , Mr . Baine is the hero any child would dream of , and his lover , Michele Morgan has all it takes to be an heroine : she's beautiful , she's tender and she's a foreigner ; moreover , she ' s French and she and the little boy are the only ones who can speak fluent French ! This is an absorbing story , where we are told that a child does not take the same view as you do , and that playing a game with him or pretending to be or to do can prove to be dangerous . The paper plane ( a telegram ) scene can compare with Hitchcock's best tricks ; there's a similar scene in " Spellbound " . This is one of the best films with a child as the hero . Like this ? Try these . . . L'incompreso ( Luigi Comencini , 1966 ) Hunted ( Charles Crichton , 1952 ) Jeux Interdits ( René Clément , 1952 ) Moonfleet ( Fritz Lang , 1955 )

After writing , Vacation , Caddy Shack , Ground Hog Day , and Stripes one expects better . All the good ideas died with Analyze this .

418384	1609079	34630	3.0	Just a Mini Ha-Ha .	Amazingly enough , here's a Daffy Duck cartoon that actually gives him a backstory ! According to ' The Daffy Duckaroo ' , it seems that our Merrie Melodies mallard WAS a big singing-cowboy star , but he gave it up because ( as he says ) " I want to be a lone . . . ranger . " If this premise had come along a few years later , when audiences were much more familiar with Daffy - - and more aware that his lust for fame and fortune vastly surpasses his singing ability - - nobody would believe it . But this is a comparatively early Daffy toon , when the character was still developing , so . . . what the heck . Riding along through the Painted Desert , Daffy encounters a winsome Amerindian maiden , a sweet Sioux who pitches woo to him while speaking in a prole Jewish accent . ( Not a Brooklyn accent , as somebody else has claimed on this site . ) She holds up a sign marked " DO NOT DISTURBUM " . But along comes her boyfriend , a huge Red Indian with a big beezer named Little Beaver ( an obvious reference to the ' Red Ryder ' B movies ) . For some reason , Daffy decides to dress up like a squaw to take the squawk out of this guy's tomahawk . Heap ugh ! I try to make allowances for earlier generations ' taste in humour . The Warner Brothers cartoons have an ongoing motif of female impersonation , which can be very funny unless ( stand up , Bob Clampett ) it gets too fetishistic . And I also understand the Looney Toons ' penchant for racial humour , regrettable as it is . But when those two themes both happen at the same go , I stop laughing . When Bugs Bunny impersonates a Japanese woman ( in ' Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips ' ) or here , where Daffy pretends to be an Amerindian girl , I find the racial impersonation ON TOP OF the sexual impersonation to be just a bit too distressing . Daffy Duck en femme simply isn't as funny as Bugs Bunny in that same mode . Daffy dressed as Minnehaha rates , at best , a mini ha-ha . SPOILERS COMING : Warner Brothers toons from the World War Two era tend to finish with a gag that was very topical at the time , but which is incomprehensible to modern audiences . ( Such as a reference to ' A cards ' . ) In ' The Daffy Duckaroo ' , a fast-paced chase sequence abruptly peters out with a wartime shortages gag about rubber tyres , ending in a very weak joke about a putt-putt : a vehicle designed for low fuel consumption , in the days of severe petrol rationing . Since wartime shortages and rationing were far worse here in Britain than in Daffy Duck's America , I just can't laugh . Daffy dropped a brick this time , and I'll rate this cartoon just .
574398	4532636	85970	7.0	Keaton and Garr in a Battle of the Sexes	Aw , come on folks , why the low rating at IMDb ? OK , so " Mr . Mom " ain't exactly " Masterpiece Theatre , " but it's a very good , solid comedy that holds up surprisingly well today . Michael Keaton is one of those actors who I've always found to be intensely likable , no matter how good or bad the movie he happens to be in . The material in " Mr . Mom " is mostly played for laughs , but it's not without some serious truths about the roles men and women play ( or at least played ) and the challenges each faces when he / she enters the sphere traditionally reserved for the " other . " This film nails perfectly that depressing funk it's so easy to fall into when your day consists of household chores and daytime television . And conversely , it also understands the difficulty in balancing a challenging career with home responsibilities . Teri Garr is her usual adorable self as Keaton's wife , and Martin Mull is a little too good as her smarmy boss .

The film begins with Elvis accidentally killing the boyfriend of a woman who tries to pick him up in a bar . In jail for manslaughter , he learns to play the guitar .

The movie isn't very good , although Elvis looks , and sounds , terrific - the superb " Jailhouse Rock " production number isn't just one of the highlights if this film , it's one of the best in ANY Elvis film . Judy Tyler is a sweet , atypical leading lady for Elvis . Elvis ' acting performance is uneven , at best .

470254	1532177	117998	5.0	I Feel Slightly Cheated	TWISTER is one of those Summer blockbuster pop corn movies so I shouldn't be too hard on it but I kept getting the impression it was nothing more than an overblown TVM like NIGHT OF THE TWISTERS OR ATOMIC TWISTER . There's a lot in common style wise with these latter TVMs featuring a lethal column of wind . The heroes are very nice people but also very superficial and lacking real depth while the cameras disappear when there's some really spectacular carnage on its way . This expensive blockbuster cheats in the same way as NIGHT OF THE TWISTERS when the main characters survive a terrible tornado that devastates a small town , devastation that happened off screen . While the budget of the aforementioned TVM wouldn't have stretched convincingly enough to show us lives ended and homes destroyed TWISTER has far less of an excuse . I often found myself bored watching the tornado sequences on screen . Tornado might be spectacular but there also very similar in appearance and unfortunately the special effects here aren't too special with the CGI explosions being especially unconvincing to a demanding and blasé audience who cry out to be left breathless by FX technology It's an inoffensive film but don't expect too much
553638	989035	96223	4.0	Dryly irreverent . . . ridiculous . . . and sometimes very funny	" Tapeheads " , a scrappy , intermittently funny spoof of the music video business , might have been the perfect comedic short , and stars John Cusack and Tim Robbins are effortlessly in the swing of the nonsensical chaos involved . They play two semi-savvy security guards in Los Angeles who start their own company , Video Aces , making hilarious videos for groups , parties , and one deathbed star . It's too bad the filmmakers had to invent a dim side-plot to pad the running time ( shenanigans involving a crooked politician and his henchmen which doesn't do much except take away from the movie's primary strength , sending-up the music culture of the late-'80's ) . Still , Cusack and Robbins create a couple of originals here : nerdy but loose , street-smart without being hipsters or posers , these guys are on the same nutty wavelength , and they never put each other down . They are the real thing in buddy-comedies . from
498431	1355507	39017	6.0	Not the best in the series .	Terror by Night begins in London at Euston station as the worlds foremost detective Sherlock Holmes ( Basil Rathbone ) & his trusty assistant Dr . Watson ( Nigel Bruce ) board a train to Edinburgh . They have been hired by Roland Carstairs ( Geoffrey Steele ) to protect ' The Star of Rhodesia ' , an extremely valuable jewel owned by his mother Lady Margaret ( Mary Forbes ) after an attempt to steal it in London has already failed . Scotland Yard send Inspector Lestrade ( Dennis Hoey ) to keep an eye on things as well . It's not long before Roland has been found murdered & the Star stolen , Holmes , Watson & Lestrade are on the case . . . Produced & directed by Roy William Neill Terror by Night was the last but one in a series of Holmes films that totals fourteen made between 1939 & 1946 to star Rathbone & Bruce as Holmes & Watson . While it's by no means the best in my opinion it's not too bad a watch . The script by Frank Gruber moves along at a nice enough pace & at less than one hour in length it's no real surprise . The central murder mystery is OK but everyone seems more interested in the stolen jewel rather than the death of Roland . Things progress as you would expect & the final revelation doesn't come as much of a surprise even including the somewhat implausible twist . The suspects are sparse , there aren't many clues or red-herrings & as a whole it's a weak entry in the series . Director Neill does OK , obviously shot on a stage there are far too many establishing shots of the train which look awful as a toy model is used . The interior is repetitive & the amount of shots where people close their compartment doors & draw the curtains is annoying to say the least . Technically the film is OK , nice enough black and white cinematography , decent production design & it's generally well made . The acting is OK at best with Rathbone putting in one of his poorest performances of the series in my opinion , Bruce & Hoey play their parts for laughs as usual . Terror by Night is an OK way to pass an hour or so but there are better entries in this particular series . Disappoionting overall but still just about worth a watch .
568274	2721657	32247	7.0	Life is worth dying for	SPOILERS Sentimental little Christmas movie involving three life long friends who in trying to pep up their somewhat lonely Christmas Eve get together in roping in two young strangers who make their holiday season a lot better and far more rewarding . So much better that they just refuse to go back to their maker , and heaven , after they ended up dying in a tragic plane crash . The three old guys Irish Michael O'Brien , Charles Winninger , British Allan " Chad " Chadwick , A . Aubrey Smith , and American businessman George Melton , Harry Carey , end up bonding with their unexpected Christmas guests Texas cowboy James Huston , Richard Carlson , and children clinic volunteer Jean Lawrence , Jean Parker , who end up becoming their lifelong , and even beyond life , friends . Becoming almost inseparable both James and Jean drift apart when their three old benefactors , with Michael leaving James a cache of money to continue his fledging singing career , unexpectedly perish in a plane crash . Being stung by success , as the new American Idol , James gets hooked up with Broadway singing sensation Arlene Terry , Helen Vinson , who's just nuts about the handsome but shy Texas cowboy . This has Michael , who's stuck in the world between life and death , try to somehow show the love sick James what a mistake he made in tossing his one and only true love , on earth and beyond , Jean away for the manipulated and scheming Arlene . Both Chad and George also hang out in what seems to be the Astral World , an existence between life and death , for a short time until they finally get their bearings straight and ascend to heaver . Chad ends up going to heaven with his dead son David , William Bakewell , who was killed in the Great War or WWI . The cranky and penny pinching George finally found out , after his death , that money isn't everything if your in a place , the world in between life and death , where its not worth the paper that it's printed on and also sees the light , heaven , by the time the film is over . Only Michael gets involved with the world of the living in his attempt to save James from a fate worse then death in both losing Jean as well as his life by getting himself involved with Arlene . James in fact does see the light after he's shot and killed by Arlene's drunk and jealous ex-husband-Mr . Terry I presume-and is given a second chance to return back to earth , and life , to reunite with the girl that he left behind Jean . Nothing really new here even though the movie predates the far more popular and very similar Frank Capra Christmas Classic " It's a Wonderful Life " by some six years . The film " Beyond Tomorrow " nevertheless still packs quite a wallop in movies about life after death and what it's , our very meager existence , really all about in the grand scheme of things . There's also in the film the two Czarist Russian survivors of the Commnist Revolution Madame Tanya , Maria Ouspenskay , who's the only one in the movie who can see or sense the three dead plane crash victims and her stuffy and stoned faced butler Josef , Alex Melesh . It's Josef who at times when his face was frozen stiff looked like the newest member , even though he never was a US President , of Mount Rushmore .
505021	2911571	82237	6.0	a film only a mummy could love	This is a rather odd attempt ( I guess ) at capitalizing on the popularity of Dawn of the Dead and mixing it up with your garden-variety mummy curse sort of flick , and it misses more often than it hits , but it does pick up a bit towards the end and the mummies are suitably creepy as they munch on hapless fashion models and Egyptians alike . Maybe part of the problem is that it's more a mix of " Blood Feast " and Dawn of the Dead , or at least the mentality of " Blood Feast " , sub-par acting , trashy looking sets , etc . The story is basically that a bunch of fashion models and their sadistic photographer have gone on a shoot in Egypt when then accidentally stumble across tomb robbers , an American slime ball and his compatriots , and then they wander into the tomb and decide this is the ideal place to shoot . Of course they're wrong , and there's a crazy old woman who is always around to let them know , at least for a while . The mummy that's cursed has a name that comes off the tongues of those who know him sounding a lot like " Superman " but I'm sure that's not it , no blue tights or red cape are in evidence . Overall this is a fairly muddled mess , but some parts were much better than others , and evil cannibal mummies , well , now I ask you : who could resist ? Well , OK , maybe lots of people could , and should . .

After entering the stands and grabbing his 3 , 000 hit ball from the hands of a young fan ; Ross retires and parlays his achievement into a strip mall based on his 3 , 000 hits . Some time later the owner of the Brewers ( Christopher Noth ) realizes that attendance is headed for an all-time low and decides to put some butts in the seats by having a Stan Ross day . That is when Stan realizes he had very little respect from his former teammates . . . but the fans still loved him . Upon checking stats in the record books it is discovered that three of Ross ' hits were counted twice . . . leaving him three short of the actual three thousand hits . Stan " The Man " comes out of retirement and rejoins the dismal Brewers at the end of a season that finds them in reach of finishing third in their division . All Stan needs is three hits and finds it easier said than done . He discovers that he really missed the game that he took for granted . He now found enjoyment in giving advise to the younger players . And he found himself refurbishing a broken down relationship with an old flame Mo ( Angela Bassett ) who works for ESPN no less . Funny man Mac doesn't look too out of place as a ballplayer . I wish there was a way Bassett's role could have had more screen time . Also in the cast are : Michael Rispoli , Brian J . White and Paul Sorvino . Sexual content and language makes for a strong PG-13 .
493224	3280905	41509	10.0	" Be Elegant , Be Arrogant , Be Smart ! ! "	Danny Kaye's films with Samuel Goldwyn established him as a leading movie comedian - singer from 1944 through the late 1940s . For a number of years after he continued his popularity without Goldwyn in films like " Knock on Wood " , " The Court Jester " and " Merry Andrew " . It is likely that " The Court Jester " is his best film , but " The Inspector General " is close to the top . Based on a 19th Century satiric play by Nicolai Gogol , Kaye plays Georgi , a decent fellow who works for the bullying Yakov ( Walter Slezak ) . Yakov and Georgi travel around the countryside selling " Yakov's elixir " which is supposed to cure all kinds of illnesses ( that Kaye sings in a tongue-twisting song by Sylvia Fine , his wife ) . But they are forced to flee when Georgi tries to stop an elderly woman from wasting her money on the elixir . Naturally Yakov is upset , and sends Georgi away until he learns to be crooked . Yakov has been using a fake official document signed by Napoleon as a come on in his sales pitch . Georgi is carrying it . He is arrested by the town constable ( Alan Hale Sr . ) for vagrancy , but the latter reads the letter . As the Mayor ( Gene Lockhart ) and his cohorts are awaiting ( with dread ) a visit by Napoleon's Inspector General to check their records ( they have been feathering their nests ) , they think that Georgi is this Inspector General . When Yakov comes to town he quickly grasps the situation , and pretends he is the " Inspector's " servant . Slezak knows that there are real opportunities here . The funny thing is that Gogol's play is not quite like the film . First of all , Gogol was writing a critique of government corruption in the Russian Empire under Tsar Nicholas I ( 1825-1855 ) . Gogol was a religious mystic and satirist ( best recalled for his unfinished novel about serfdom , " Dead Souls " , and his novellas " The Diary of a Madman " and " The Overcoat " ) . Normally Nicholas was a humorless despot , who hated intellectuals . But he liked THE INSPECTOR GENERAL , which attacked the worst aspects of Russian local government corruptions that the Tsar did want to see eradicated . Because he approved , the play was a great success , and became one of the few 19th Century plays that became part of the permanent world repertory . But Gogol's targets were Russian , not French . Napoleon is not a background figure in the play . The Inspector General ( actually the title is " The Government Inspector " in Russian ) is from the Tsar . They have heard rumors of the corrupt practices , and are checking them . Georgi's character is not such a well-intentioned type in the play as he is in the movie . He is as willing to feather his nest as Yakob is , and they prove to be a highly successful team . This is because the Mayor and his cohorts are quite willing to bribe their way out of the current investigation . This includes selling the Mayor's wife for sex , and paying out much in bribes and " gifts " . And in the end , after " Georgi " and Yakob leave with their loot , the Mayor thinks he will be called to St . Petersburg for some really important post . But months later they hear of a letter circulating in the capital from " Georgi " boasting of how he fooled the Mayor and his cohorts . Then , just as things couldn't get worse , a servant announces the arrival of " a Government Inspector " to review the books . Everyone freezes in terror as the curtain falls . The film softens " Georgi's " character , leaving Yakov as the greedy one ( although Slezak does redeem himself at the end ) . The Mayor and his cohorts ( who do things like collecting for a church bell but pocketing the money themselves ) do try to kill off the Inspector General - there is a funny sequence at a party where " Georgi " sings a song about " sing Gypsy , dance Gypsy " , and keeps on just avoiding drinking his doctored drink during the song . Georgi's guardian angel protects him . He also meets Leza , a servant ( Barbara Bates ) and falls for her . He debates how to appear before her as a General - should he be elegant like an Englishman , arrogant like a Russian , or smart like a German . In some ways " Soliloquy for Three heads " may be the best of the numbers in the film . Although watered down from Gogol's stunning comic play , enough entertainment value remains in the film to make it worthwhile viewing , and a highpoint in appreciating Kaye's movie career .
428802	3079504	86640	8.0	Classic Sex and Gore Fest	First off this film is pure exploitation . This is sex and violence and really gross , even by todays standards . Its not the best film ever made , but if you want gore and worms and gross things with your beautiful naked women this is for you . This film belongs in the exploitation hall of fame . A very bare bones explanation of the plot has a beautiful woman having an affair because she is bored with her husband of a couple of months . She wants to run off with her lover , who is also married , but he won't go . Getting out of her car on a lonely stretch of road she finds a phone and calls her husband who's cab driver . While she is waiting she is raped and killed by two guys . The husband uses the services of a black magician he once saved to get revenge on the killers and the lover . Its gross fun from that point on . The sex is early on as we see the very beautiful wife naked in the shower and having sex with her lover . Proving that this is exploitation at its finest we have a slow motion topless jog along the beach . This film has a reputation for being gross out royalty and its nice to report that this certainly is the case . This is a film that will have you going " yuck " quite often . Done before CGI this film is helped by knowing that what you see is what you get , people really are spiting up insects and such . The problem for me was that it seems oddly paced . Don't get me wrong the plot moves , but at times it seems a bit talky , which is odd since what you see is what you need to see and hear . See this film . I rated it as a , but thats for most people who want to see a gross out horror film from overseas . For hardcore exploitation film fans or those who love gross effects this is a classic and should be .
454899	11228318	1001592	8.0	Cougars is another funny episode of " 30 Rock "	Okay , here's this week's " 30 Rock " plot in a nutshell : After making excuses for declining co-workers ' invitations , Liz is convinced by Jenna to become a " Cougar " ( i . e . an older woman preying a younger man ) after a coffee boy gets interested in her . Fellow comedy writer Frank also gets interested in him making Frank " gay for Jamie " . Jack and Kenneth offer to help Tracy with his boys club baseball team which almost leads to disaster . Needless to say , things gets awkward for Liz when she first reveals how much older she is and finds out how much younger Jamie is ( " This just went from a senior dating a freshman to Mary Kay Letourneau . . . " ) and then how his mother resembles her . Later , Frank finds out at a gay bar how non-gay he truly is . . . Mostly pretty funny if not hilarious episode of " 30 Rock " here . Loved many of the lines from Liz to Jamie about her trying to get some of his culture and him not getting many of hers ( except the one about Demi Moore ) . Also liked many of Tracy's kids lines about being certain stereotypes when they grow up . And then many of Frank's and Jenna's attempts to one-up Liz were pretty highly amusing ( Loved Frank's painting of a " one-armed mermaid who's part unicorn with Bigfoot " ) . Too bad " 30 Rock " hasn't picked up enough numbers in audience size . . .
442630	819382	219699	6.0	Let us now praise Blanchett .	A widow with ESP ( Cate Blanchett ) lives with her son in a small Southern town , helping people by trying to " read " their futures and living on donations . There are folks who don't like that kind of devlish stuff ' round here . Katie disappears . Blanchett , who is one of those psychics who cannot control their " visions " so that she can only get glimpses of things that have happened or might happen , has a vision of Holmes ' body at the bottom of a pond . She reveals her vision to the Sheriff ( good performance by Dr . Emil Skoda , I mean J . K . Simmons ) . Well , he's one of the local empiricists and doesn't believe her but takes her out to a pond resembling the one seen in her vision . Sure enough . They drag Katie's remains out of it . Where was Tom Cruise when she needed him ? I won't go on with the plot . It gets twisted around a bit and the end won't come as a great big surprise if you've seen a couple of other thrillers with metaphysical overtones . It was written by the co-authors of the far superior , " One False Move . " But this is a pretty weak effort . We hear New Age lines from a bunch of small-minded townies . A man and a woman are attracted to one another but when he comes on to her , she backs hesitantly away and says , " I don't think this is a good idea right now . " ( The guy is falling-down drunk so it's hard to see what the idea was in the first place . ) " She's gone , " the man tells the woman , " but I have to learn to live with that , just as you have to learn to live with the loss of your husband . " ( Real MEN don't talk like that . ) And , later , " I'm so sorry I wasn't there for you when you needed me . " The director , Raimi , is efficient without being in the least original . The music cues us about looming threats . When Blanchett is worried , a shadow crosses her curtain - - but it turns out to be a friend ! As the climax approaching , to heighten the tension , there is a windy thunderstorm full of rain and strobe lightning . ( Ho hum . ) At the end , when all is being revealed , the rain is replaced by fog . One blow from a flashlight conks a full-grown man out for the duration just because the script calls for it . Blanchett is about to be murderized at the pond but she is saved by a disturbed young man whom she had earlier tried to help . The young man , Giovanni Ribisi , is supposed to be in a psychiatric hospital but , " I escaped , " he tells her . He doesn't tell her how he managed to find her and her would-be murderer in the middle of the woods in the middle of the night in the fog . Well , not that it matters , because it turns out that Ribisi has actually been dead for a couple of hours anyway . This takes us beyond the possibility of ESP and into the realm of the frankly supernatural . This raises certain interesting questions but the film doesn't address them . It's satisfied to be another everyday thriller with parallel universe harmonics . All of that makes it sound like a movie to avoid but it's not . The reason it's not is that mysteries are kind of interesting . Whodunnit , you know ? And the movie is saved by Cate Blanchett's sterling performance . She makes the movie . She isn't exactly beautiful . She's lean and narrow shouldered . Her nose is long and pulpy , and her epicanthic fold is overdeveloped by Western tastes . But faces have characteristics or traits . Angelina Jolie's primary trait is sexuality . Gene Tierney's was staggering beauty . Agnes Moorehead's was sliminess of a particularly feminine sort . Blanchett's primary trait is perceptivity . Not intelligence in any academic sense , but an ability to figure things out , to see through them , to discern patterns and form Gestalts . This trait is put to good use , of course , in a role that calls for psychic abilities , but she showed the same ability to use her skills in " Elizabeth " too , where instead of hesitancy and anxiety the role called for a growing self confidence . Her accent alone is fascinating . Her Commonwealth speech is quite thoroughly transformed into Southernness here . It's not the hillbilly speech of the upland South , and it's not from the low country either . Its closest analog is probably Texas or Oklahoma . She has even the slightest of marks down right . " I didn't really think anything OF it . " And the vowel is prolonged and drawn out in a manner only found in the American South . ( The same speech sound is heard in the vowel in " druuuunk . " ) Sorry . Bit of regional linguistics there . Oh - - I ought to mention wardrobe too . A fine job . They've given Blanchett exactly the right unpretentious floppy clothes that an ordinary lower-middle-class Southern widow of no sophistication might wear . Example : In one important scene , she wears this fuzzy white V-necked sweater - - angora or cashmere or something . ( I don't know anything about women's clothes but I know what I like . ) Underneath this sweater , though , there is a rough white T shirt that leaves a cartoon alligator's face peeping over the sweater's V neck . Exactly the proper degree of sloppiness . Yet in another scene , at a party , her hair is draped around her long face is lustrous curls and when she reaches down to remove a tight shoe we can't help noticing how sleek her ankle and her feet are , and neither can Kinnear , the guy she's with . But without Cate Blanchett's superior performance this would be no more than a routine thriller . With her , it rises rather above the routine and is worth catching .
399707	1391795	53611	7.0	Fun and engaging low , low-budget schlock .	In a Florida swamp , the locals are starting to disappear . What could be the culprit ? It's all right there in the title . Stoic , hunky game warden hero Steve Benton ( Ken Clark ) , with the assistance of girlfriend Nan Greyson ( Jan Shepard ) and her father ( Tyler McVey ) sets out to investigate what we in the audience already know . Executive produced by Roger Corman and produced by his brother Gene , this A . I . P . flick is not all that bad for its type of film . Director Bernard L . Kowalski establishes the sense of danger and a chilling mood right from the get-go , crafting a tight and trim little sci-fi / horror flick clocking in at just over an hour . The level of atmosphere is right up there , as well . Actor Leo Gordons ' script is amusing , with some decidedly goofy lines here and there . Best of all is the scene in the underwater cave with the monsters approaching their victims and then chowing down on them ; this scene is surprisingly graphic and nasty for a 1950's film . In addition to our likable leads , 1950's era hottie Yvette Vickers ( the mistress in " Attack of the 50 Ft . Woman " ) lights up the screen as Liz , the dissatisfied wife of burly store owner Dave Walker ( a solid Bruno Ve Sota ) who likes turning on the sex appeal any chance she gets . Gene Roth is hilariously surly as an incredulous sheriff . The monsters themselves may be on the blatantly cheesy side , but they ultimately add to the appeal of the film . And , basically , that's really what it's all about . It's just fun , plain and simple ; aside from yet another dig at the advent of atomic energy with a perfunctory possible explanation for the creatures ' existence , this is extremely unpretentious , engaging nonsense .
418027	663392	36758	5.0	Hard to Believe this Film Entertained Anyone	Watched this film on TV and found this film one big COMEDY with also murder , steam rooms , message parlors , dead bodies appearing in almost every room of a hotel . Jean Parker , ( Kitty O'Day ) , " Dead Man's Eyes " ran around and sounded like Lucille Ball and always had a hat on her head no matter where she was ; in elevators where a man was electrocuted . Kitty also ran around in circles with Peter Cookson , ( Johnny Jones ) , " Detective Kitty O'Day " , who was trying to keep Kitty safe and out of his way so he could solve a crime and at the same time try to keep her safe . This film was so way out in left field , I could hardly believe that anyone would find this film entertaining . I love old time films from way back when , but this particular film I really could have avoided watching .
573965	4532636	121791	7.0	Gasp ! A Documentary with a Point of View	This is one of those fascinating documentaries that came out during WWII that made no attempt to be anything other than war propaganda . It's so funny now to see people get all hot and bothered by films like " Fahrenheit " and crucify Michael Moore for pushing such a blatant agenda . They act like before Moore came on to the scene , no documentarian ever had a point of view or tried to manipulate audiences to think a certain way about an issue . Obviously , these people have never seen any of the propaganda films that came out around this time in world history , or for that matter any films by Frederick Wiseman , Leni Riefenstahl , Robert Flaherty or a hundred other documentary film makers who have been making movies for the last 80 years . " Target for Tonight " is actually kind of laughable now , because it's SO heavy handed . But don't lost sight of its historical context and forget that this movie and others like it were deadly serious in their intentions .
574341	4532636	387131	7.0	A Not Completely Successful Thriller	Thinking back on " The Constant Gardener " the day or two after having seen it , I found much about the film to admire ; however , my primary feeling while actually watching it was one of exasperation . This film is all rush , rush , rush from one scene to the next , barely giving the viewer time to catch his breath , let alone catch up to the plot . This is another one of those thrillers that thinks if it just moves fast enough , it will keep the audience members on the edges of their seats . It fails to realize that no amount of momentum can make a movie interesting if it doesn't make clear what everyone is rushing around for . Fernando Meirelles is certainly an intelligent director , and his earlier " City of God " is sensational and by far one of the best films of the decade so far . He employed a similar frenetic style to that film , but it felt more in tune with the subject matter . In " The Constant Gardener , " that style too often merely distracts . But like I said at the beginning of my review , and despite all of the negatives I just summarized , there's much to admire here . The acting , for one , is top notch . Ralph Fiennes is always reliable and doesn't disappoint , but I was most impressed with Rachel Weisz ; she in particular is so good that I wish she had been given more screen time . The relationship between their two characters is what sets this film apart from any other standard , run-of-the-mill political thriller , but at the same time it feels awkward . It's almost as if Meirelles has two different films going at the same time and isn't completely successful in merging them . The script , again , is intelligent , but more confusing than it needs to be . And the confusion factor isn't helped by Meirelles's jittery , busy camera , that at times induces headaches with its refusal to slow down . I can acknowledge that this film is good in many ways , but I still came away slightly disappointed with it , especially given all the hype it's received . I already feel like I need to see it again before I completely form my opinion , but only because I thought it was confusing and distracting the first time through , not because I feel like a second viewing will reveal it to be a richer film . I doubt a second viewing is going to improve my opinion of the film's clunky , preachy ending .
366441	3109237	69850	4.0	Did I see this move ?	- I had planned to write something explaining what I didn't like about this movie , but this is going to be more difficult than I thought . Honestly , I can't remember much about it . I watched it just three days ago and it's made almost no impression on me . That's usually the sign of a real stinker . About the only thing I remember was being incredibly bored by most of it . The novelty of having a Humphrey Bogart look-a-like as the detective wore off real quick . It would be different if he could act , but he's a one-note entertainer . The kill scenes were amateurishly handled and there was no suspense leading up to them . If you can't spot the killer five minutes into the movie , you need to see more Euro horror . The casting is a dead giveaway to the killer's identity .
533054	70535	249757	10.0	Riveting documentary . . . . or was it ?	This was one of the most interesting films I've come across in a long time . It is so well done that it will have the viewer wondering whether or not it is genuine . I particularly enjoyed Julio and his hypocritical tirades after being ' found out ' . Also , the waffling of Beverly on ' did she or didn't she ' had me rolling in the floor . All of the characters were fascinating and Shino's difficulties concerning his sexuality was one of the high points . 5 stars .
401436	7743887	563124	5.0	" Come on England ! "	Duncan , Dick and Andy are looking forward to a Saturday afternoon in front of the telly , watching a football game between England and Wales . So keen is he to see the English hammered the Scottish Andy is kitted out in Welsh national costume . But Duncan is unexpectedly recalled to duty . To spoil his friends ' fun , he tells Gascoigne that an old Busby Berkeley musical is on B . B . C . - 2 . Gascoigne is almost assaulted when he tries to change the channel . Loftus shows up , and the film is put back on . Dick pulls the plug out of the wall , and makes it appear as though the set has broken down . Just as they are getting into the game , two T . V . repair men take the set away , claiming they are part of a faulty batch . . . I remember reading an article in ' The Sunday People ' ( as it was then called ) in 1977 , which credited ex-doctors turned comedy writers Rob Buckman and Chris Beetles with having ' saved ' the ' Doctor ' series . This made no sense ( it was not renewed after this season ) , as their episodes are nowhere near as funny ( in my view ) as those of Steve Thorn and Paul Wolfson . This one is like the ' No Peace For The Wicked ' episode of ' Porridge ' in that the main character ( s ) is looking forward to a planned Saturday afternoon , only to be continually interrupted at every opportunity . But the two are worlds apart in terms of execution . To get revenge on Gascoigne for his continual interruptions , the lads trick him into thinking that an Italian patient ( played by Ricardo Montez of ' Mind Your Language ' fame ) has a mysterious unknown disease . Oh ha-ha . Funniest moment - the bit at the end where Gascoigne gets revenge on his tormentors by magnanimously sending them a television set to watch the match . However , it has no screen , valves or tubes , just a football dangling on a piece of string inside the box !
435910	9938570	120524	6.0	Wishmaster	A Djinn is a demonic genie caught between two worlds who needs the person who calls him to ask for three wishes so that he can release his legion upon the earth . Shannon ( Wendy Benson-Landes ) unfortunately blows on a gem , created by a wizard to hold the Djinn inside , wiping it on her shirt so that she could get a clearer picture of it's center not knowing that was how you release the demonic genie from his cage . The Djinn takes the face of a dead corpse and names himself Nathaniel ( Andrew Divoff , who is perfectly cast as the purely evil demon in human form ) . The theme of " Monkey's Paw " is utilized in this film as anyone who desires a wish from the Djinn suffer the consequences losing their very soul in the process . These victims are merely a pawn in the Djinn's game for proposing that Shannon use her three wishes to halt the torture that will take place to those who made wishes . The climactic showdown between the two occurs in an cultist artifacts collector , Raymond Beaumont's ( Robert Englund playing a " normal " character for a change ) party where he wishes his shindig were like another in the past ( the one Djinn suggests . . the very gruesome one the viewer was privy to at the beginning in the past when a King's people were being slaughtered by the Djinn ) . The slaughter at Beaumont's party is quite graphic as well . It will come down to one last wish and whether or not Shannon can make it one that will not backfire releasing pure evil the entire Earth can not overcome . Making up for the silly premise is the film's outrageous graphic violence . People die in hideous , unusual ways . The idea that wishes can spawn evil to those who desire them is merely used as a tool to flood the screen with various means of bloody death . But , Divoff as the demonic genie is very effective and there are many cameos from B-movie types such as Buck Flower playing , yes you guessed it , a homeless person who wishes for pharmacist Reggie Bannister to die of Cancer because they hate each other . You have Ted Raimi in a small role as Robert Englund's assistant . The Tall Man Angus Scrimm even has the credit of narrating the opening introduction to the Djinn and where they came from .
487200	386241	91193	5.0	Forget the " names " . . . . Nelia is the real show here	Maud Adams ( of " Octopussy " fame ) is a Nazi hunter who tries to get close to an infamous Nazi war criminal ( Stewart Granger ) by marrying his nephew . But the Nazi finds out her plans and has her killed . Now it's up to her daughter and a young soldier ( who saves her life ) to go to Paraguay , discover the Nazi's secret base and take him out . Despite being shot on location in Brazil and Paraguay , and having some semi-big names in the cast ( it must be noted that George Lazenby has a very small role ) , " Hell Hunters " is a low-grade , fairly unbelievable action film that moves in fits and starts . Main point of interest , for me at least , was a strong action-girl supporting role for the beautiful Nelia J . Cozza , who helps the heroes in their mission . The female lead is not bad either , she looks a bit like Martha Plimpton . ( )
419065	1609079	70424	6.0	The middle portion of a bleak triptych .	' My Ain Folk ' is the second of three autobiographical films written and directed by Bill Douglas , recounting his childhood and adolescence . In all three films , the protagonist - - ostensibly Bill Douglas's alter ego - - is cried Jamie . The name change warns us that some fictionalisation is in the works , but we're never told precisely at which points in the story , nor how extensively . The most famous case of this sort of substitution would be the example of Francois Truffaut and his cinematic alter ego Antoine Doinel . I suspect that Jamie conforms more closely to Bill Douglas's life than Doinel to Truffaut's . SPOILERS AHEAD . Cleverly yet bitterly , this movie opens with displays of triumph . We see a collie ( a Scottish breed ) standing atop a mountain above a glorious vista of landscape , in full colour . This quickly turns out to be a Lassie movie being screened in Jamie's local cinema , a tuppenny fleapit in a coal-mining town . From here out , the rest of the film is in monochrome . From collie to colliery in one painful reel change . I found the first instalment in this trilogy , ' My Childhood ' , so utterly realistic as to be a painful experience . ' My Ain Folk ' , by contrast , felt slightly more like something Dickens invented for one of his novels . ' My Childhood ' bleakly but expertly limned the utter desperation and grinding poverty of Jamie and his half-brother Tommy , raised by their elderly ' gran ' while their mother languishes in a mental institution . Very realistic and compelling . Here in ' My Ain Folk ' , up pops some tosh about a necklace which Jamie's mother has hidden , which apparently has enough value that someone else wants to find it . Pull the other one ! Although I'm more than a decade younger than Douglas , I came from a background very similar ( in Perthshire and a Glasgow council estate ) and I know damned well that people this poor never have any heirlooms . Any object that can stave off hunger for a couple of hours is sold , bartered or pawned . Throughout this bleak trilogy , Douglas uses apples symbolically : they seem to represent prized treasures which are highly desirable in this impoverished landscape . In ' My Ain Folk ' , there's a close-up of a large dish containing only one small Bramley apple and a set mousetrap . This felt to me like the sort of art-house image which director Douglas normally avoided . . . but it turned out that there was a legitimate reason for placing the trap next to the apple . During one shot of Jamie standing astride the local railway line , we hear on the soundtrack an offscreen train coming steadily nearer and louder , yet Jamie shows no inclination to get off the sleepers . ( In the previous instalment , he actually lay down with his head on the rails ! ) Suddenly the train comes hurtling into the frame . . . on a different track we hadn't noticed before . This one shot reminded me of several Buster Keaton films . Elsewhere in this movie , the soundtrack cuts out entirely . I started to put this down to alienation or some other symbolism , but apparently Douglas just had grotty film recording . After the death of Jamie's gran , the film ends with a slight note of triumph : we see a Highland band marching downhill ( another symbol ? ) while piping ' Scotland the Brave ' . In all three instalments of this trilogy , Douglas wrings astonishing performances from a ( mostly ) non-professional cast , and gets full benefit from the cinema-verite settings . I found the first instalment of this bleak trilogy ( ' My Childhood ' ) deeply depressing yet moving , partly because some of it resembled my own experiences . I found ' My Ain Folk ' equally depressing yet less cathartic . I'll rate this downer , mostly in recognition of Douglas's skill rather than his depressing choice of subject matter .
571011	4248714	493430	9.0	Jackass Number Two	Four years after the series ended , and a great movie , the boys came back for more normal camera stunts . Starring Johnny Knoxville who does nearly anything , Bam Margera who does anything , but also plays jokes on his parents Phil and April , Steve-O , Chris Pontius sometimes playing Party Boy and Bunny the Life Guard , Ryan Dunn , Ehren McGhehey , fat Preston Lacy , Jason Acuña , or Wee Man , Dave England , Jeff Tremaine ( directed the movie ) and Rick Kosick . This sequel is much more daring than the first movie . It includes a penis puppet show with starring a snake , butt chugging , sticking a hook through the side of a mouth ( for human fish bait ) , butt branding , drinking horse spunk , eating horse crap , and the most surprisingly dangerous , making a cab driver believe a terrorist was going to the airport , he got a real gun out ! With guest appearances by Tony Hawk , and film directors Spike Jonze ( Being John Malkovich ) , also producing and writing , and John Waters ( Pink Flamingos ) . Very good !
572816	4248714	114069	7.0	Outbreak	From director Wolfgang Petersen ( In the Line of Fire , Air Force One ) , this is really good film with a deadly virus spread by a cute monkey . Basically somewhere in Africa many people have been dying of an unknown virus , and it Col . Sam Daniels ' ( Dustin Hoffman ) job to make sure it does not spread any further . For now he investigating along with girlfriend Robby Keough ( Rene Russo ) , Maj . Salt ( Cuba Gooding Jr . ) and Maj . Casey Schuler ( Kevin Spacey ) to find the cause , the speed , the impact , and the cure ! The bad news is that he does not know what is causing it , and soon enough it spreads to America , and we know it is a monkey that is the cause / source . The virus pretty much makes your skin break up , melt kind of , and a lot of coughing and puking . Also starring Morgan Freeman as Brig . Gen . Billy Ford , Donald Sutherland as Maj . Gen . Donald McClintock and Patrick Dempsey as Jimbo Scott . With some action sequences , panicking , and a real bastard Sutherland , who thinks the situation will end if he blows up the town ! Very good !
434399	2171244	140588	6.0	Anti-war nazisploitation	While this isn't one of the infamous nazisploitation video nasties like Gestapo's Last Orgy or Love Camp 7 , it would have probably made the list if they tried to release it in Britain . It is nazisploitation , make no mistake , even though it has more of a story than the similar Salon Kitty . A Jewish couple are separated by war and she ( Sirpa Lane ) is sent to a love camp to service German soldiers . It includes an average of about eight breasts a minute , rape , actual penetration , lesbianism , bloody caning , eugenics , girl-on-girl , : all the features of a typical nazisploitation . Soon Hannah ( Lane ) attracts the attention of a Nazi officer ( Giancarlo Sisti ) , who takes her home . She fits right in , which is not surprising for someone who let her mother ( Margherita Horowitz ) die for her before she was captured . Her reunion with her beloved Klaus ( Roberto Posse ) , who was now a German officer , was not pleasant . She ends up running a high-class brothel like Salon Kitty , without the Caberet singing . She re-finds her identity before she dies . WWII aficionados will appreciate the extensive use of actual war footage in the film to stretch it out with little cost .
406738	2020269	36027	8.0	Not your usual brain-eating corpses . . . and that's a good thing !	First of all : PLEASE don't let the misleading , rather silly sounding title discourage you ! I walked with a Zombie is another brilliant result of the collaborations between producer Val Lewton and director Jacques Tourneur . Released one year after the simply astonishing movie ' Cat People ' , this is yet another intelligently elaborated and genuinely original genre-masterpiece . The solid screenplay contains a rarely seen before amount of eeriness and handles about a young ambitious nurse who goes to San Antonio in order to take care of Jessica . Jessica is the wife of plantation-owner Paul Holland and she suffers from a bizarre mental paralysis , supposedly caused by a tropical fever . She is ? in fact ? a zombie only not the type of walking corpse you usually expect in horror movies . Betsy , the nurse , is somehow convinced that Jessica may still be cured and turns to the Voodoo-community that is living on the island as well . Just like he pulled it off in Cat People , Tourneur manages to bring suspense in a subtle way . Without bloody images but with a unique photography and efficient set pieces ! I walked with a Zombie contains great dialogs , intriguing characters and mind bending plot-twists . This is an intelligent and demanding film , especially made for people who take this genre serious ! It ranks slightly under ' Cat People ' but light-years above most other horror films . Check it out !
504102	2911571	304927	3.0	Weasels rip my wallet	Lordy Lordy , I can certainly say this film caused me to re-examine my definition of " Z-grade " horror films . Is there a lower rating ? I guess not . And to think that thanks to modern technology this piece of junk is available on DVD . . . . . wow , to think I've been missing out all this time . This makes " Blood Feast " and " Horror House on Highway 5 " look like " Gone with the Wind " or perhaps " It's A Wonderful Life " . So the idea I guess , is that a space probe or something ( which is obviously a tiny model rocket ) crashes on Long Island and some kids find it and dump some goop down a weasel hole , which results in a mutant rabid weasel that is bigger than a man . Most of what you see in reference to mutating weasels and body parts is completely unfathomable , as in you have no idea what you're looking at . Some hapless goons stumble into the nest of a mad doctor / scientist / whatever , and one is subjected to weasel blood infusion , I guess , after which he becomes a rampaging were-weasel . I guess some of this was worth a laugh , but the sound quality is horrible and the music cuts in and out , and overall if they were going to put this on a DVD they should have at least cleaned some of it up . But perhaps I'm missing the point , maybe that adds to the charm . Yeah , right . Maybe stars .
479232	463200	248667	4.0	Muddled	Pic follows Muhammed Ali from 1964 to 1974 chronicling his winning the heavyweight championship , losing it and winning it again . This could have been good , but it fails in so many ways . For starters , Will Smith is totally miscast as Ali - - Ali was handsome , full of life and charismatic - - Smith is none of those things . When he shouts out Ali's rhymes he comes off like a loudmouth jerk - - he totally lacks Ali's sing-song voice and great personality . His face is always blank all during the film - - even the fight scenes ! No depth of character comes through . Also ( although I realize this is a matter of opinion ) Smith is ugly - - Ali wasn't . All in all he's not a good enough dramatic actor to carry the film . The script is lousy - - very scattershot . It jumps all over the place and characters appear and disappear at a disturbing rate . For instance . . . Ali meets his second wife at a religious meeting . They just hold hands . The very next scene they're married , have a house AND a baby girl ! Michael Mann's direction doesn't help . It's constantly in closeups of the character's faces . This makes sense during the boxing scenes . . . you're right in there in the ring . But when it's constant it gets very annoying . . . especially at 160 minutes . And the film is way too long . Two hours and forty minutes is overdoing it . The only good thing about this is all the actors ( except for Smith ) are great in their roles - - especially Jon Voight doing a dead on impersonation of Howard Cosell . And the fight scenes are good . But this isn't worth seeing . If you want a good boxing movie rent " Raging Bull " or even " Rocky " .
450884	2093818	100828	6.0	Has real potential , but in the end , it's just too convoluted and long-winded	This sounded pretty good . . . Nicholson is mostly fun to watch , and I enjoyed Chinatown immensely ( Towne returning to write this sequel was a treat , as well ) . I enjoyed it for a while , but not too far past the half-way point , I realized that it had run out of steam . . . the film kept rolling , but it no longer kept the viewers ' attention . Jack Nicholson is no director , and it shows . . . while he is a skilled actor , he should stay in front of the camera instead of trying his hand behind it . The cinematography is close , but doesn't quite make it to being good . . . we have shots that linger , and wasted opportunities aplenty . Polanski's loose , involving camera is sorely missed here . The pacing is also off . . . the film ends up seeming heavy as a result . The writing is quite good . The acting varies , but is mostly on the positive end . The tone isn't entirely sure what it wants to be , but does create some great " noir " moments . Jake's monologues are occasionally spot-on . The mystery varied some . . . parts of it , I had figured out before the lead , whereas others only became clear to me just as they were revealed . This is a hit and miss scenario . . . and unfortunately , it misses more than it hits . This is worth watching as a continuation of Chinatown for those that want more of the plot , and can compromise with the drop in style and finesse of the film-making values . I recommend this to big fans of Jack Nicholson and those interested in seeing what occurred after the events of Chinatown .
490635	33913	96580	8.0	It Wasn't Amazing but It was Good !	This show had legs and an interesting plot . Jon Cryer plays Teddy Z , a guy who doesn't want to work in the family business , a Greek bakery . Instead , he would rather work in show business . he gets a job in the mail room and gets the attention of a film star who wants him as his agent . With little or no experience , Teddy Z gets the most unlikely promotion . I remember Alex Rocco as the old time agent without a heart or conscience who is Teddy's mentor . I remember Jane Sibbett as the cold , ruthless woman working to get to where Teddy is . Teddy got there by being himself and not some determined , egotistical college graduate who start by working in the mailroom and hope to be secretaries with a promotion to agents . Too bad , they cancelled it after a year .
428972	3079504	66893	4.0	good if you like grade Z entertainment	Set in Coney Island this is the story of a psycho killing people on the midway . I'll leave the actual plot for you to work out when you see this . This is one of those so bad its good movies , one where your jaw hangs open in disbelief at whats going on . Take for example the music . Its folk music . Why ? I have no idea . I don't think anyone who had a brain cell couldn't see that the music chosen has nothing to do with whats going on on screen . Its so opposite to what you are seeing it grates on you . Its occasionally acted and partially written which makes it somewhat watchable . Its a movie to get drunk and watch laugh at . Its interesting to watch the carnival scenes since its incredibly obvious that they are filming at an operating carnival since people are constantly looking at the actors in a puzzled manner . The crowd scenes after the opening decapitation are fall down funny . As is the response time of the police and medics to the crime scene , never has help arrived that fast in New York . If you're in the mood for grade Z entertainment I recommend the film for a nights rental .

In many ways , this film had a plot some what like " Body Heat " which is filled with Hot Sex , Nudity , murder and plenty of violence .

487297	386241	90944	3.0	A complete waste of time .	Truly terrible , pretentious , endless film . Director Bellocchio seems to be infatuated with the pretty face and figure of his actress Detmers - and who can blame him ? But maybe , just maybe , he should have focused his attention a little more on making a good , engaging film . I hate it when a sex film poses as an " art film " just to become more " respectable " . The frequent , occasionally hot sex scenes are the only reason for this movie's existence . Whether or not they are worth sitting through the rest of the picture is strictly a matter of taste . ( )
479609	463200	83642	9.0	Sadly forgotten	Big , splashy , fun musical about a whorehouse ( the Chicken Ranch ) in Texas run by Miss Mona ( Dolly Parton ) . She's in love with the sheriff ( Burt Reynolds ) and the town has no problem with the house . Then a sleazy TV showman ( Dom DeLuise ) exposes the ranch and all hell breaks lose . This was a huge bomb in 1982 for some reason . It's full of energy and enthusiasm , has great songs and some fantastic all out production numbers . Reynolds is just OK but Parton is an absolute joy - - she gives one of her best performances and even sings " I Will Always Love You " ( I prefer Whitney's version ) . Also there is equal amounts of male and female nudity and has a healthy attitude about sex ( this was made before AIDS was well-known about ) . And Charles Durning stops the show with his " sidestepping " number . . . he was nominated for Best Supporting Actor for this . This should never have bombed - - maybe the title scared people away . Only complaint is the ending . It's way too serious and realistic - - I wish they had opted for a fairy tale like ending . Also Lois nettleton's subplot is seriously underdeveloped - - I assume it was shot but cut out for the running time . See it and enjoy !
402645	453228	66636	7.0	I love detective shows	I love detective shows . One can watch Cannon on TV Land . I never saw a detective show with a fat , out of shape protagonist . The same formulated detective series , of running around asking question , with the usual confrontational climax . The viewer is assaulted with the out of the blue investigation breaks leading to figuring out the case . The usual plot devices of a found phone number , or random run in with character directs the story . The weired musical score sets a strange tone ! A very 70's show because of the music , cloths , social message , and characters . The quality of filming and acting has come a long why from the 70's . Still a interesting show spy cams for Cannon .
538671	3717154	959337	9.0	no one forgets the truth , they just get better at lying . . .	It's 1955 . Frank and April Wheeler , in the seventh year of their marriage , have fallen into a life that appears to most as being perfect . They live in the Connecticut suburbs with two young children . Frank commutes to New York City where he works in an office job while April stays at home as a housewife . But they're not happy . April has forgone her dream of becoming an actress , and Frank hates his job - one where he places little effort - although he has never figured out what his passion in life is . One day , April suggests that they move to Paris - a city where Frank visited during the war and loved , but where April has never been - as a means to rejuvenate their life . April's plan : she would be the breadwinner , getting a lucrative secretarial job for one of the major international organisation's , while Frank would have free time to find himself and whatever his passion . Initially sceptical , Frank ultimately agrees to April's plan . When circumstances change around the Wheelers , April decides she will do whatever she has to to get herself out of her unhappy existence . . . Going to show how the other half live , this is a bleak and depressing motion picture , but very emotional throughout . Winslet and Dicaprio are amazing as the Wheelers , another couple who are realising that there life is just passing by and that they are becoming the one thing that they both dreaded , living a normal ( re : uneventful ) life . the dreams they both had when they were young are long gone , and the one chance that they have of being something different is disrupted by major events , that would usually make any other household elated . Mendes makes the film very difficult to watch at times , the couple are desperately trying to be the same couple as they were when they first met ' invincible ' , but they are fighting a losing battle . and finally when self realisation comes knocking at the door , the film becomes harrowing to watch , especially in the final act when April becomes an emotionless shell ( the scene with her making breakfast is unbearable , and makes the film atmospherically disturbing ) . it's a very hard , but rewarding film with touchy subject matters that obviously won't be for everyone , but Mendes proves again that he is a master film maker and some of the performances are amazing . well worth watching .
564854	102816	294097	10.0	As funny as it is weird	I first came across Birdman while on holiday in Majorca when I was 13 . I remember vividly watching it with these 2 hot German twins and laughing whenever he shouted ' Bi-ii-irdMAN ' . It was really , really corny . But this was back in the day when Cartoon Network didn't have much to show other than the really old-fashioned 1960's and 70's stuff . The last thing I ever imagined is that Birdman would come back in the 21st century to be re-invented as Harvey Birdman , Attorney at Law at the Sebben and Sebben law firm . He's a bit of a dunderhead . And a bighead and a sociophobe and rude but you can't help but love him . Avenger is still his sidekick ( only cuter than he was previously ) and his boss is Phil Ken Sebben , a one-eyed ladies man . Among the various , random people who work for the firm are Peanut ( a Birdman wannabe ) , Peter Potamus , Reducto and a big cuddly bear who always seems to be smiling ( and applauding all on his own at inappropriate moments ) . My fave character has to be Judge Mentok the Mindtaker ( OOOOO-EEEEEE-OOOOOO-EEEEEE ! ! ! ! ) , he just really , really funny . Harvey's typical cases involve him defending the likes of Shaggy and Scooby , Fred Flintstone , Boo-Boo and George Jetson . Getting in the way of cases going smoothly are and abundance of rapid-fire jokes that come at you from all angles and will probably disorientate you if you're not sure where they're coming from . Sometimes you might have to watch an episode twice as the the dialogue is usually delivered very quickly and you might lose your place among the cryptic references and wildly outlandish humor . In truth , it's a show for Adults . Even though the jokes are only mildly suggestive there is no way a child could fully understand everything that is going on unless they are an uber-uber-geek . This is a show made for people who love stuff like Family Guy , not Spongebob Squarepants . Oh , and I love that theme song . They must release some kind of soundtrack CD for this show . Why ? Because Mentok WILLS it so !
498432	1355507	122685	2.0	" Vampires need blood that's not contaminated by human semen . " Worthless .	Riti , Magie Nere e Segrete Orge nel Trecento ( which translates into English as Rites , Black Magic and Secret Orgies in the Fourteenth Century apparently ) , or Black Magic Rites as it's more commonly known as along with other suggestive titles such as The Horrible Orgies of Count Dracula & The Reincarnation of Isabel , starts in the crypt of a large castle with a sacrificial offering to a Vampire / witch named Isabella ( Rita Calderoni ) ' the great mistress ' who was burned alive in the fourteenth century . An unfortunate woman is tied to a stone slab & her heart is cut out by Isabella's husband who happens to be Count Dracula ( Raoul Rossi ) himself ! But without any fangs . In a ritual of the twenty-fifth moon Isabella will be reincarnated , anyway another woman named Raquel is killed & her heart removed . Laureen ( Rita Calderoni again ) & Richard are engaged to be married & Laureens uncle Jack ( Mickey Hargitay ) has brought the castle for her , they are holding a big party & various guests fall victim to Isabella's reincarnation rites as she needs the heart & eyes of a virgin or something like that & that's as well as I can explain the ' story ' , if I've got something wrong don't bother letting me know as I don't care . This Italian production was written & directed by Renato Polselli ( he directed under the pseudonym Ralph Brown ) & quite frankly is one of the most incoherent , bizarre , strange , baffling & worthless films I've seen in a long time . The script probably made some sort of sense as the written word on a piece of paper but in the hands of Polselli , sorry Brown it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever . I'm not exaggerating when I say I seriously doubt anyone will be able to follow this thing & make any sort of sense out of it . People do things for no apparent reason , their motivations are baffling , the story is an absolute mess that's all over the place , the character's are virtually indefinable & it's hard to keep track of who's who , the dialogue is minimal & the subtitles lead me to believe it's very basic & Polselli tries his hand at a bit of comedy with a idiot bloke who has a threesome with two women complete with comedy soundtrack & a bit where he tries to remove a hair from his mouth , I'm not sure if the hair came form the women or his terrible moustache ! There is also some weirdo hunchback guy named Greg ( ! ) ( Marcello Bonini Olas ) & references to Count Dracula & Vampires as if things weren't strange enough already . I don't even think Riti , Magie Nere e Sergrete Orge nel Trecento should be called a ' film ' & I'm sure most would agree that you need to be taking something to enjoy this , the filmmakers obviously did ! Director Polselli certainly gives the film a unique look , it has very rich colours & a cool visual style throughout but bathing people & things in bright neon lights for no reason whatsoever just adds another layer of bizarreness to the proceedings . Anyway it's pretty nice to look at . The editing is atrocious as it cuts to random scenes , things & people that seem to have nothing to do with the current situation . Even simple scenes of two people talking become highly irritating as Polselli cuts , zooms & pans all over the place . The continuity is unbelievably bad , just check the scene out when the two women are chased through the village it switches between bright daytime & the dead of night seemingly at random ! There's a bit when someone is buried & from the outside the coffin is a normal size but when the film cuts inside it's massive ! There is plenty of naked flesh on show & a couple of ripped out hearts but nothing too explicit . Technically the film alternates between very good & extremely stylish to the most poorly made atrocity I've seen , there's a bit at the end with a ' snake pit ' which has all of two rubber snakes in it ! You can see the wire / string pulling them along ! The awful rubber bats aren't any better either . The acting is , well not great but then look at what they had to work with . Basically nothing . Riti , Magie Nere e Segrete Orge nel Trecento is an absolute mess of a film , it's confusing , muddled , incoherent & worst of all it provides virtually zero entertainment value . It's certainly unique & I doubt there are too many film out there like this but that in itself is not recommendation . It has a few nice visually stylistic moments in it , a few babes & a couple of ripped out hearts , apart from that it's worthless .
385308	391152	65622	10.0	A great masterpiece	Pier Paolo Pasolini might be the most underrated director of all time . You hear almost nothing about him nowadays , except how disgusting Salo was . But , in my mind , Pasolini ranks evenly with the other great masters , Fellini , Visconti , De Sica , Antonioni , and Rosselini , perhaps better than them . Pasolini is probably the most humane of all of them ( even when considering Salo ) . The Decameron is a perfect representation of Medieval European humor . Perhaps those unfamiliar with Medieval literature should avoid it , but all Medievalists must see it at some point . The stories are hilarious , and the human stories are beautiful . Just take a look at any face in the film . Pasolini is such a great lover of beautiful faces . Not that all the faces represent the standard concept of beauty , but the ones that might be considered ugly are exceedingly beautiful .
491606	3280905	422762	7.0	Hostages for Bolivar	I saw this thirty four years ago on television , and it has never been shown since . It was a play by Emanuel Robles that was translated and rewritten by Lillian Hellman , and the cast , led by Keir Dullea as Montserrat and Rip Torn as Izquierdo ( the Spanish officer and torturer ) . It is Venezuela ( then part of the Spanish South American Empire ) in the 1820s . Simon Bolivar was leading the revolution , and winning . Izquierdo is trying to find him , and knows that Montserrat is a close associate of Bolivar , and can tell him where he is . So he arrests Montserrat , and grabs five innocent civilians ( including Geraldine Page , Hurd Hatfield , Alexander Scourby , and Jack Albertson ) , from a city square . Then he tells Montserrat that he will kill these hostages one at a time , unless he gets the information from Montserrat . If Montserrat cooperates he'll release them and let Montserrat live . It becomes a battle of character between Montserrat and Izquierdo , who is battling memories of his own humiliation at the hands of Simon Bolivar's men in a recent campaign . The hostages try to force Montserrat to recognize the duty he supposedly owes to them , and he keeps arguing against this pressure . In the end we watch both men basically lose , as Montserrat maintains his honor , and Izquierdo realizes he has gained little - and is giving his services to forces he himself has little respect for . I wish they would revive it . Like many of the televised dramas of early television history ( 1950 - 1975 ) it is possibly no longer in existence , which is a shame . But if it is maybe it can be shown again . It was a good play .
544899	562732	337978	8.0	" Another day in paradise ? "	Before I say anything about Die Hard 4 , I just want to remind everyone that anything that has anything to do with computers in the movie serves no purpose other than to drive the plot and to provide for some surprisingly effective comic relief . There is tons and tons of nonsense about hacking into this and hacking into that and how only 9 guys in the world could do such and such with a laptop and blah blah blah blah . Don't take the time to try to figure out exactly what they're talking about , even if you're a computer expert ( actually , ESPECIALLY if you're a computer expert ) , because it's just going to distract you from the rest of the movie , which is a pretty powerful argument that there is still a place for an old-school NYPD officer in the 21st century . Let's review , shall we ? Die Hard is still among the dwindling list of movie franchises where the original movie is still the best one . Part 2 was a cartoonish mess , and part 3 , despite essentially plagiarizing the first Dirty Harry movie , was not the same thriller as the original but was still a great action movie . There have been many complains about casting Justin Long alongside Bruce Willis as his sidekick in this movie , because he's so well-known as the guy from the Apple Computer commercials . Maybe I watch too many movies and not enough TV , but to me he will always be known as the phenomenally idiotic Darry Jenner from Jeepers Creepers . Good God I hated that movie . McClane has moved up in the world from reckless , irresponsible New York Cop to reckless , irresponsible absentee father who has little to do with his teenage daughter's life until some jerk drives her home and gets a little too pushy with her . John saves her from getting groped by some meathead , but she's still pretty unappreciative . Their relationship hasn't been so great over the years . Soon John is called to duty to pick up some kid named Matt Ferrell , who is on a short list of computer super-nerds wanted by the U . S . government due to a recent glitch in the national security computer systems . John thinks nothing of the assignment until a high-tech assassination attempt is made on the kid , and he discovers that he's not the only person trying to track him down . It seems that everyone else on that short list has been executed by some shady organization , and John has to keep his cool trying to figure out who and why while they're trying to kill him and while , in the meantime , they manage to kidnap his daughter . There is tons of great action in the movie , although detractors can easily call attention to the fact that the plot-line is clearly designed to set the stage for the next action pieces . Personally , I thought the action pieces were awesome , so I could really care less if there isn't exactly an Oscar-worthy script underneath it all . There is also the issue of the epic over - the-topness of some of the action pieces , such as the pilot of the fighter jet who can't seem to hit a lumbering SEMI truck , but can pilot his machine around under freeway overpasses , dodging bridges and whatnot . But again , I feel like the over-the-topness , while not a huge part of the original movie , was introduced in part 2 , explored a bit in part 3 , and now has developed to a point where it is one of the most appealing parts of the movie . Put it this way ? there is a scene in the movie where McClane takes down a helicopter , and if you are unimpressed with how he does it ( and his reaction , which I would argue is one of the funniest parts of the whole movie ) , then you're either in the wrong frame of mind or this is just not your kind of movie . Justin Long didn't have much to do in the film except crack jokes and pop out his handy roll - up keyboard and hack into anything that needed hacking within a few seconds , although he didn't detract from the movie as much as you would expect , given his iconography . Kevin Smith is purely hilarious as Long's super-geek buddy , and later the two teamed up again with Zack and Miri Make A Porno , in which Long was the star of one of the movie's funniest scenes . Timothy Olyphant is perfect as the movie's main villain , Thomas Gabriel . He's a little too clean-cut and flawlessly dressed and groomed , but he looks like a cross between Christian Slater and a young Jack Nicholson , and that's not a bad place to be if you're a Die Hard villain . It's just too bad that he's saddled with ancient action clichés like " You have no idea who I am and what I'm capable of ? " But the biggest problem with the casting is Maggie Q as Mai , Gabriel's crazy hot assistant . She's not only a super-genius computer hacker who can bring down national communication mainframes with a few strokes of the keyboard , but she's also a martial arts expert who , if Jason Statham and Jet Li were in this movie alongside Bruce Willis , she could hold them all off for a while , too . Hell , she might even have the pure , unadulterated ass-kicking know-how to make Steven Seagal bleed his own blood . Can you imagine ? The villain's main plot also falls apart pretty thoroughly ( his plan to download the country's financial data from a " backup " location is feared to throw the nation into irreversible chaos ? what does " backup " mean again , exactly ? ) , but this is a nearly perfect summer action blockbuster .

It also turns out that a key which belong to Naomi was on the rug which ruined her vacuum cleaner and the rug as well . Well , Naomi and Mama decide to take it to court . Michael Constantine is memorable as the judge who must decide who is right and wrong . Of course , Mama makes references to Judge Wapner and People's Court and offhanded comments .

443359	819382	35616	9.0	Exemplary Hawks	An exciting , touching , and funny movie , one of Hawks ' best . It's a richly textured work , with several sub-narratives weaved into one another . The most important is the voyage of the new B-17 , the " Mary Ann " , from California to Honolulu to Wake Island to Clark Field in the Phillipines . Movies about journeys can be exciting , if they're well done , as this one is . There is the change of scenery , the dramas large and small at the stopovers , and above all the living that goes on within the vehicle . There is a lot of model work involved , out of necessity , but it has a reassuring cartoonish quality . I loved those wooden miniature airplanes taking off without lifting their noses , as if levitating rather than flying . And the tiny papier-mache palms , and the fake studio jungles . Within the limits of the available technology , it's pretty well done . As the model B-17 taxis its way across the tarmac , we can even hear the squealing of its brakes as the pilot applies them . The voyage is fascinating not just because we are following the Mary Ann , but because we get to know what it's like to live inside the fuselage , to fly and defend the airplane , to work on its engines and to feed it gasoline by using a bucket brigade . Most of all we get to know the tiny social system of the men and how they are knitted together by circumstances into a solidary group . This is true Hawks territory . Here we have John Garfield as the cynical flight-school washout Winocki . ( Cf . , Christopher Walken's monologue in " Pulp Fiction . " ) Garfield sneers at the others and hates the skipper , the good-natured , efficient , and highly respected James Ridgely as " Irish " Quincannon . Ridgely tries to explain to Garfield that it doesn't matter what any single person's feelings are . We are all part of a team here ; each of us depends on the other ; we support and help one another ; we'd give each other our last pair of socks ; in fact , two of the crew are married to each other . ( Well - - not that . ) Garfield is finally won over after the attack on Pearl Harbor . ( Kids , that was the beginning of World War II for us . PS : We won . ) The way the crew learns the news is just plain fine . What craftsmanship . The radioman is sitting at his console and loses contact with Honolulu before picking up some gunshots and Japanese chatter . It's a sign of the care that was taken in this film that we get to appreciate the job that the RADIOMAN is doing ! In almost every other film involving a bombers we get to know only the pilots and the gunners - - sometimes the bombardier . But in this case we get to see the kind of job everyone does , including the crew chief , and , in a suspenseful miniepisode , the navigator . The NAVIGATOR ! Usually if he's included at all , it's only to get his head blown off . Hawks is fond of the gradual integration of an outsider into the group , the willing penetration of social borders . Sometimes it's a " girl , " as in , " Only Angels Have Wings . " ( When Jean Arthur sits down to play the guys ' piano , Cary Grant advises her , " You'd better be good . " ) Here it's Garfield , who begins by hating the Air Corps and ends by being a fully functioning team member , and an innovative leader . If that's not enough , we have yet another playful rivalry between the Mary Ann's crew and a passenger they pick up - - a pursuit pilot who jokes about the furniture vans that bomber crews have to fly around in . Does he turn into a fully functioning team member at the end too ? Yes , he does , although as far as we know he's had to multi-engine time at all . No matter . The essence of Hawks ' fascination with male solidarity is probably best expressed in the scene in which the Mary Ann is being attacked over a ( fictional ) Japanese fleet . As a Zero homes in on the B-17 from a given position , the gunner on that side yells out to the captain , " Swing her a little to the left ! " , and Ridgely makes the airplane yaw slightly to give the gunner a better shot at the Zero . Let me put this another way - - an enlisted gunner is telling the captain of the airplane what to do . And the officer happily complies . That is teamwork . The crew transcend their individuality . They're like a single organism . " Irish " dies towards the end in a scene that could have been so much cornier than it is . ( Faulkner is said to have written part of it . ) Everyone of importance is in the death scene and plays a part . The movie practically falls apart at the end , unfortunately . Our airplanes seem to blow the entire Imperial Japanese Navy out of the water in a battle that resembles nothing of historical value . And yet even the final scene , of the Mary Ann crash landing in the rolling surf , is exciting enough to help us forget the obvious propaganda of the previous scene . The problem , though , is that the racism runs all the way through the film . Okay , let's accept dialog like , " Fried Jap going ' down ! " , when a Zero explodes . But the Japanese in Hawaii are treated as treacherous cowards , which , by the time of this movie's release , should have been a myth long dispelled . Of course there was never any sabotage . They were American citizens before they were Japanese . Anyway , an outstanding adventure movie . Nothing arty or pretentious , simply a nicely executed work . One of the best films to be made during the war .

They forget to let the ladder down before they jump into the ocean for a swim . The boat proves impossible to climb . They are stuck in the water many miles from shore , with baby Sara left alone on board . Sara's mother Amy must contend with her aqua-phobia as well as the group's increasing desperation , as the friends begin to turn on each other . Soon the exhaustion of keeping afloat and the struggle to get back on board begin to take a terrible toll . The happy reunion turns into a fight for survival . . . obviously cashing in on the success of open water , and while this is not an official sequel to open water , it follows along the same line . even though open water was based loosely on fact , this is all fiction . but the story is a lot more griping and the performances and production values are a lot more convincing . this time there are no sharks or danger in the water , but if you are a parent , you will know the terror that the parents are facing during their ordeal . the performances are great if corny , and the cinematography adds to the tension . if like me , you despised open water , then you may not want to see this , but it is worth watching .
422465	2248099	157044	10.0	In a word : brilliant	François Ozon's pitch black mickey take is a biting satire on family life and a brash distraction from the shows of it's title . While many sitcom's are monotonous affairs , Ozon's take on the medium is anything but . Despite taking in many of the clichés of the sitcom - stuffy mother , raunchy maid , bored father etc - Sitcom manages to be continually inventive and the way that it exposes the clichés of the genre is both ludicrously ridiculous and harshly disturbing . The French director proves with this movie that he's not afraid to overstep several boundaries and make a film that dares to be different , and for that reason this film will never be universally liked . However , if you can connect with Ozon's vision , you're in for a treat and that was the situation I found myself in ! The story follows a father who , after bringing his family a lab-rat for a present , finds his family collapsing around him - his son discovers he's gay , his daughter jumps out of the window and his wife . . . well , I'll leave you to find that out on your own . Sitcom is a singularly unpleasant experience . Watching family life deteriorate is a much more gruelling affair than you might imagine , and even though the family and the situation that Ozon has presented are utterly ridiculous ; he still manages to inject life into it , which ensures that it hammers home the point that the auteur intended . Whenever I see a film that dares to be different and deliver something that I haven't seen before , I tend to find myself heaping the praise on it and that is certainly the case with this film . You will not find a comedy with a more rotten core than this one and similarly you will not find one that dares to present the utterly ridiculous happenings that this movie thrives on . I don't know how Ozon thought he could get away with some of the things in this film - not just the taboo's he's portrayed , but other things too , some of which are just too stupid to comprehend ? but Ozon makes them work ! Sitcom is a movie that needs to be experienced , and it's a film that will divide opinions as much as any other movie ever made . And if only for that reason - see this film as soon as possible .
